--- ROLE-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (apply after reviewing the diff above) ---

BUG FIX COMPLETENESS (required when PR title/body matches: fix|bug|patch|repair|resolve|hotfix):
Before writing "confirmed" for any fix:
1. Trace the stated fix path: file:line → file:line (show the chain)
2. Enumerate adjacent edge cases — or explain why none exist for this change type
3. Semantic verification for data transformation changes

SECURITY: If the diff contains auth, API, middleware, or session handling code:
1. Check OWASP Top 10 — flag any matches at Critical severity
2. Flag insecure JWT patterns: no expiry, no rotation, secret in code
3. Flag rate limiting absence on public auth endpoints

TYPE SAFETY (#10): Beyond \`as any\`, flag:
- Prefer \`unknown\` over \`any\` for external inputs
- Prefer discriminated union over boolean flag proliferation
- Prefer type guard functions over bare type assertions

LOGIC VERIFICATION: For each changed function, trace edge inputs (n=0, n=null, empty array).
Never auto-confirm implementation correctness — trace 2-3 edge cases explicitly.

ERROR HANDLING: For all changed code paths:
1. Flag swallowed errors — catch blocks that log-and-continue without re-throwing or surfacing to the caller
2. Flag error messages that lack context (operation name, input values, affected resource)
3. Flag async errors without proper typed handling (unhandled promise rejections, missing error type narrowing in catch)
