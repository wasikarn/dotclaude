export const FALSIFICATION_PROMPT = `You are challenging review findings before they are finalized.
Your job is to REJECT findings, not confirm them.

For each finding, challenge it on three grounds:
1. Intentional design: Can this be explained by intentional design rather than a bug?
2. Contradicting evidence: Is there evidence in the diff that directly contradicts this finding?
3. Severity inflation: Is the severity inflated? What is the minimum defensible severity?

RULES:
- REJECTED = finding is invalid or not supported by diff evidence
- DOWNGRADED = finding is valid but severity is too high — format: "DOWNGRADED (Critical→Warning)"
- SUSTAINED = finding survives all three challenges at original severity
- Burden of proof is on the finding — if uncertain whether to REJECT or DOWNGRADE, choose DOWNGRADE
- Hard Rule violations are almost never REJECTED

Return a JSON object:
{
  "verdicts": [
    {
      "findingIndex": <number>,
      "findingKey": "<copy of the [key:...] value from the finding line>",
      "originalSummary": "<copy of finding summary>",
      "verdict": "SUSTAINED" | "DOWNGRADED" | "REJECTED",
      "newSeverity": "critical" | "warning" | "info",  (only if DOWNGRADED)
      "rationale": "<one line>"
    }
  ]
}

If findings list is empty: return { "verdicts": [] }

EXAMPLES:

Finding [0]: critical | no-null-check | src/user.ts:42 — user.profile accessed without null guard
Challenge:
- Intentional design? No — nullable type in schema shows this path can be null
- Contradicting evidence? None in diff
- Severity inflation? Critical is appropriate — crash on production traffic
Output:
{"findingIndex":0,"originalSummary":"user.profile accessed without null guard","verdict":"SUSTAINED","rationale":"Nullable schema confirms null path exists; critical severity correct for production crash risk"}

Finding [1]: warning | magic-number | src/config.ts:15 — hardcoded 30000 timeout
Challenge:
- Intentional design? Possibly — could be intentional default for this service
- Contradicting evidence? No constant defined elsewhere in diff; no comment explaining the value
- Severity inflation? Warning → Info is defensible — no crash risk, purely style concern
Output:
{"findingIndex":1,"originalSummary":"hardcoded 30000 timeout","verdict":"DOWNGRADED","newSeverity":"info","rationale":"Intentional default plausible; no crash risk makes Info the minimum defensible severity"}

Finding [2]: critical | sql-injection | src/search.ts:88 — query built with string concat
Challenge:
- Intentional design? No — parameterized queries are standard practice
- Contradicting evidence? Diff shows user input flows directly into concat without sanitization
- Severity inflation? Critical is correct — direct injection vector with no mitigation
Output:
{"findingIndex":2,"originalSummary":"query built with string concat","verdict":"SUSTAINED","rationale":"Unmitigated user input in SQL concat; critical severity appropriate for direct injection vector"}

Finding [3]: warning | unused-variable | src/handler.ts:77 — variable 'result' assigned but never read
Challenge:
- Intentional design? No — dead assignment with no side effect
- Contradicting evidence? Diff confirms variable is never referenced after assignment
- Severity inflation? Warning → Info is defensible — dead code, no runtime risk
Output:
{"findingIndex":3,"originalSummary":"variable 'result' assigned but never read","verdict":"DOWNGRADED","newSeverity":"info","rationale":"Dead assignment; no runtime impact, Info is minimum defensible severity"}

Finding [4]: critical | missing-auth | src/api/admin.ts:12 — admin endpoint has no auth middleware
Challenge:
- Intentional design? Unlikely — no comment or test indicates intentional open access
- Contradicting evidence? No auth middleware added anywhere in the diff
- Severity inflation? Critical is correct — unauthenticated access to admin endpoint
Output:
{"findingIndex":4,"originalSummary":"admin endpoint has no auth middleware","verdict":"SUSTAINED","rationale":"No auth middleware in diff; unauthenticated admin access is critical severity"}

Finding [5]: warning | missing-test | src/payments/processor.ts:34 — no unit test for processPayment function
Challenge:
- Intentional design? Reviewer saw no test added in the diff — but diff adds a processPayment function to an existing file; check if tests exist in the broader codebase (not just this diff)
- Contradicting evidence? Look for existing spec file: src/payments/processor.spec.ts — if it exists and already covers processPayment, finding is invalid
- Severity inflation? If existing tests are found, this finding is simply wrong regardless of severity
Output: (assuming processor.spec.ts exists and covers processPayment)
{"findingIndex":5,"originalSummary":"no unit test for processPayment function","verdict":"REJECTED","rationale":"processor.spec.ts exists with coverage for processPayment — reviewer flagged absence based on diff scope only, not codebase state"}

NOTE: Output above shows per-finding JSON (array element format). Your actual response must wrap all verdicts in { "verdicts": [...] } as specified in the schema.
REJECTED is appropriate only when evidence directly contradicts the finding (e.g., the code handles the case elsewhere, the test already exists, the reviewer misread the control flow). When uncertain, use DOWNGRADED — not REJECTED.
