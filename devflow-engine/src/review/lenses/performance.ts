# Performance Review Lens

Inject into reviewer prompts when diff touches: data fetching, list rendering, event handlers, caching, or any hot path code.

\`\`\`text
PERFORMANCE LENS (active for this review):

ALGORITHMIC COMPLEXITY:
- Nested loop over same/related collection → O(n²): build Map/Set for O(1) lookup
  Pattern: \`.find()\` / \`.filter()\` inside \`.map()\` → single-pass with Map
- Sort inside a loop → hoist; repeated \`.filter()\` on same array → single pass
- Unbounded accumulation: \`results.push()\` in loop with no cap/break

NODE.JS EVENT LOOP (backend — flag any sync op in request path):
- \`fs.readFileSync\` / \`execSync\` / \`spawnSync\` → async equivalents
- CPU-intensive on main thread (image processing, large JSON.parse >1MB, crypto hash
  loops, regex on large strings) → offload to \`worker_threads\`
- Large data loaded into memory fully: \`fs.readFile\` on multi-MB files → stream instead
  Pattern: \`fs.createReadStream()\` piped through transform, never \`readFile\` + buffer

ASYNC PATTERNS:
- Sequential \`await\` on independent ops → \`Promise.all([a(), b()])\`
- User-input async without debounce/throttle (search, autocomplete, scroll)
- Promise returned but neither awaited nor \`.catch()\`-ed → silent failure

REACT RENDERING (frontend only):
- Expensive component re-renders on unrelated parent state → \`React.memo\`
- Filtered/sorted arrays or callbacks passed to memoized children → \`useMemo\`/\`useCallback\`
- \`setState\` in \`useEffect\` with missing/unstable deps → infinite re-render

MEMORY:
- Event listener without cleanup: \`removeEventListener\` / \`AbortController\`
- Large object captured in closure outliving component lifecycle
- Stream not \`.destroy()\`-ed on error path

BUNDLE SIZE (frontend only):
- \`import _ from 'lodash'\` → \`import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'\` or \`lodash-es\`
- Barrel \`index.ts\` re-exporting everything → blocks tree-shaking
- Heavy dep on non-critical path without \`lazy()\` / dynamic \`import()\`

CORE WEB VITALS (frontend — INP replaced FID, March 2024):
- LCP: above-fold \`<img>\` without \`<Image priority>\` (Next.js) or \`fetchpriority="high"\`
- INP (<200ms): long sync work in click handler → \`scheduler.postTask()\` or yield with \`setTimeout(0)\`
- CLS: element without reserved dimensions, content injected above fold

TYPESCRIPT COMPILATION (flag in PR touching type definitions):
- Conditional type on large string literal union (>20 members) without intermediate alias
- Recursive type depth >3 without named intermediate → compiler cannot cache
- \`as any\` in type positions to "fix" slow compilation → find root type cause instead

EXISTING (conf ≥75):
- N+1: DB query in loop → batch / eager load
- Unbounded query: collection endpoint without LIMIT
- Missing index on WHERE/ORDER BY column (large table)
- Hot data fetched every request without cache (Redis / in-memory)
