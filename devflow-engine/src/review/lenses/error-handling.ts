# Error Handling Review Lens

Inject into reviewer prompts when diff touches: \`try\`, \`catch\`, \`async\`, \`.catch(\`, \`Promise\`, \`new Error\`, \`throw\`.

ERROR HANDLING LENS (active for this review):

HARD RULES (flag unconditionally — no confidence gate):
- Empty catch block: \`catch (e) {}\` or \`catch { }\` with no body
  Fix: log the error or re-throw; \`catch (e) { logger.error(e); throw e; }\`
- Swallowed Promise rejection: \`.catch(() => {})\` with empty callback
  Fix: \`.catch((e) => logger.error('context', e))\` minimum
- Unhandled async: \`async\` function with no try/catch where caller does not
  await with catch — silent rejection possible at runtime
- \`finally\` block containing \`return\` → discards any exception thrown in try/catch

WARNING (confidence ≥ 75):
- Silent fallback: catch returns default value (\`return []\`, \`return null\`) without
  comment explaining why swallowing is safe — misleads callers into thinking operation succeeded
- Catch-all without discrimination: \`catch (e: unknown)\` in critical path with no
  \`instanceof\` check — catches programmer errors alongside runtime errors
- Log-without-rethrow at service boundary: external call fails, error logged, function
  returns normally — upstream cannot distinguish success from failure
- Generic \`new Error('something went wrong')\` in service layer → not actionable for debugging;
  include context: \`new Error(\\\`UserService.findById failed for id=\${id}: \${e.message}\\\`)\`

STRUCTURED ERROR TYPES (flag when service has no typed error hierarchy):
- Error thrown as plain string: \`throw 'not found'\` → uncatchable by \`instanceof Error\`
- No domain error classes for expected failures: 404/403/conflict should be typed, not string messages
  Pattern: \`class NotFoundError extends Error { constructor(resource: string, id: unknown) { ... } }\`
- Catch block re-throws raw \`e\` from external dep → leaks internal error details to caller;
  wrap: \`throw new ServiceError('fetch failed', { cause: e })\`

OBSERVABILITY INTEGRATION:
- Error caught and logged without structured context fields
  Weak: \`logger.error(e.message)\`
  Strong: \`logger.error({ err: e, userId, operation: 'findById' }, 'user lookup failed')\`
- Error swallowed in background job / queue consumer without dead-letter or alert
  Pattern: wrap entire job body in try/catch; on catch → log + increment error counter + optional DLQ push
- \`console.error\` in production code → replace with structured logger

RETRY & RESILIENCE (flag when calling external services or DB):
- Network call without any retry → single transient failure causes hard error to user
  Flag: external HTTP calls, DB queries in distributed systems without retry wrapper
- Retry without backoff: fixed-interval retry on rate-limit (429) or service unavailable (503)
  Fix: exponential backoff with jitter
- Unbounded retry loop: no maximum attempt count → infinite retry on permanent failure
  Fix: \`for (let i = 0; i < MAX_RETRIES; i++) { ... }\`
- Retry on non-retryable errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) → wastes time and quota

THRESHOLD: HARD RULE items → always. All others: conf ≥ 75.

FINDING FORMAT (required for this lens):
For every finding emitted under this lens, include:
  Finding: [description of the issue]
  Hidden error types: [specific exception/error types swallowed — name them, not "some error"]
  Scenario: [specific condition where this silently fails — be concrete]

"catch is too broad" is NOT sufficient — you must name what is lost.
