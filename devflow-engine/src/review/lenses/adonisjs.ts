# AdonisJS Review Lens

Inject into reviewer prompts when diff touches: \`app/controllers/\`, \`app/models/\`, \`app/validators/\`, \`app/services/\`, \`start/routes.ts\`, or files using Lucid ORM / Vine / IoC decorators.

ADONISJS LENS (active for this review):

HARD RULES (flag unconditionally — no confidence gate):
- Raw \`process.env.FOO\` → must use \`env.get('FOO')\` (Env module validates schema on boot)
- \`db.rawQuery()\` with string interpolation → parameterised binding only; SQL injection risk
- Response data returned without Vine/schema validation → validate at controller boundary always
- N+1 via Lucid: loop calling \`model.related().load()\` individually → \`.preload()\` at query time
- Transaction missing: multiple writes with no \`trx\` → data inconsistency on partial failure

LUCID ORM:
- Missing \`.preload()\` on relations accessed in loop → N+1 queries (use eager loading)
- \`.firstOrFail()\` when optional → \`.first()\` + explicit null check; don't swallow 404 vs null
- Soft deletes: querying without \`.withTrashed()\` when deleted records are relevant → silent data loss
- Missing \`useTransaction(trx)\` on related model operations inside a transaction → partial commit
- \`Model.create()\` called with raw user input without \`$fill\` / column whitelist → mass assignment

VINE / VALIDATION:
- Controller action reading \`request.body()\` or \`request.input()\` without Vine schema → validate first
- Vine schema not imported from \`@vinejs/vine\` → wrong package, validators won't run
- Schema defined inside route handler (not extracted) → rebuild on every request; move to \`app/validators/\`
- Missing \`messages\` on \`vine.compile()\` for user-facing endpoints → generic errors reach clients

IOC CONTAINER & DI:
- \`new ServiceClass()\` inside a controller or service → breaks IoC; use \`@inject()\` + constructor injection
- \`app.make(ServiceClass)\` called at module load time (top-level await) → race with container boot
- Circular dependency between two \`@inject()\` services → container throws at runtime; use lazy injection

HTTP CONTEXT & MIDDLEWARE:
- \`ctx.auth.authenticate()\` missing on protected routes → route accessible without login
- \`ctx.bouncer.authorize()\` missing where resource ownership is required → privilege escalation
- \`ctx.request.ip()\` used for rate-limiting without \`trustProxy\` set → spoofable behind load balancer
- Exception thrown outside an async context → not caught by AdonisJS global exception handler; wrap in \`try/catch\` or return response directly

ROUTING:
- Route group missing \`.middleware()\` call for auth-required endpoints → auth bypass
- Route parameters not validated (\`request.param('id')\`) → coerce to expected type before ORM query
- Missing \`.as()\` alias on named routes used in views/redirects → hard-coded strings break on rename

EXISTING (conf ≥75):
- Controller action doing business logic directly → extract to service; controllers should be thin
- Missing \`response.created()\` / correct HTTP status codes on resource creation (201 vs 200)
- Long-running work in controller without queue job → blocks HTTP worker thread

THRESHOLD: HARD RULE items → always. All others: conf ≥75.
