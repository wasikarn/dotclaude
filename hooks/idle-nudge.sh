# Generic TeammateIdle nudge — keeps idle teammates on task.
# Config via env vars (set in settings.json command):
#   NUDGE_PATTERN      grep -qi pattern to match team names (e.g. "review-pr")
#   NUDGE_MSG          feedback message sent back to teammate
#   NUDGE_CHECK_TASKS  set to "1" to check ~/.claude/tasks/ for pending work first
#                      (omit or "0" for unconditional block)
# Exit 2 = block with nudge; exit 0 = allow.
