## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-29

### feat(sdk): two-phase triage, per-phase cost visibility, reviewer calibration

- **feat(sdk/orchestrator):** classify PR complexity — trivial (<50 lines, ≤1 domain) runs 1 reviewer instead of 3; markdown output shows ⚡ trivial note with 1/1 consensus explanation
- **feat(sdk/types):** `ReviewReport.complexity` field (`trivial|standard|complex`) — consumers can detect single-reviewer runs
- **feat(sdk/output):** per-phase cost breakdown — `Reviewers: $X | Falsification: $X | Total: $X | Tokens: N`
- **feat(sdk/cli):** falsification cost/tokens now included in `ReviewReport.cost.total_usd`; `cost.falsification_usd` tracks phase separately
- **feat(sdk/cli):** reviewer calibration — per-role stats (submitted/sustained/rejected/downgraded) appended to `~/.claude/anvil-reviewer-calibration.jsonl` after each falsification run
- **feat(metrics-analyst):** Step 6 reads calibration file and reports per-reviewer accuracy/rejection rates with ⚠️/✅ signals — runs after every build session and standalone `/metrics`
- **test(sdk):** 51 unit tests across consolidator, triage, domain-mapper, output — vitest added as devDependency

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-28

### feat!: rename plugin dev-loop → anvil, drop dlc- prefix

BREAKING CHANGE: Plugin renamed from `dev-loop` to `anvil`. All `dlc-*` skill names
dropped in favour of unprefixed names under the `anvil` namespace.

- Plugin name: `dev-loop` → `anvil` (`/anvil:build`, `/anvil:review`, etc.)
- Skills renamed: `dlc-build` → `build`, `dlc-review` → `review`, `dlc-respond` → `respond`,
  `dlc-debug` → `debug`, `dlc-metrics` → `metrics`, `dlc-onboard` → `onboard`, `dlc-status` → `status`
- Bootstrap agents renamed: `dlc-*-bootstrap` → `anvil-*-bootstrap`
- Artifact paths: `.claude/dlc-build/` → `.claude/anvil-build/`, `dlc-metrics.jsonl` → `anvil-metrics.jsonl`
- Env vars: `DEV_LOOP_ARTIFACT_TTL_DAYS` → `ANVIL_ARTIFACT_TTL_DAYS` (backward-compat fallback retained),
  `DEV_LOOP_USAGE_LOG` → `ANVIL_USAGE_LOG` (backward-compat fallback retained)
- Data path: `~/.claude/plugins/data/dev-loop-dev-loop/` → `~/.claude/plugins/data/anvil-anvil/`

## [0.6.23] — 2026-03-23

### perf: domain-scoped lens injection — reduce session token usage ~60%

- **perf(dlc-review):** domain-scoped lens injection — T1→security/error-handling/typescript, T2→performance/database/api-design, T3→frontend/observability (was all→all); specialist agent cap: max 1 in priority order (test>api>migration), skip if PR<200 lines; debate broadcast now compact format (file:line+summary only)
- **perf(dlc-build):** domain-scoped lens injection for Phase 4 reviewers — same role assignment as dlc-review; phase-4-review.md Lens Selection table updated with all 8 lenses + domain column; adds missing api-design and observability lenses
- **perf(dlc-debug):** move dx-checklist.md from Load immediately → on-demand (Quick mode only); remove `{project_conventions}` injection from both Fixer prompts — CLAUDE.md is already auto-loaded, eliminating duplicate context injection

## [0.6.22] — 2026-03-23

### feat: domain expert ecosystem upgrade — review lenses, DX checklist, code-reviewer

- **feat(review-lenses):** add `api-design.md` lens — REST status Hard Rules (201/204/422), idempotency, backward-compat (removed fields, new required params), pagination, cursor vs OFFSET
- **feat(review-lenses):** add `observability.md` lens — structured logging Hard Rules (no string interpolation, no PII), correlation ID at entry points, trace propagation, metrics naming, alerting coverage
- **feat(review-lenses/frontend):** upgrade from 8 items → comprehensive lens: RSC/App Router boundary, hydration mismatches, streaming + Suspense, Server Actions security, accessibility, missing key props
- **feat(review-lenses/error-handling):** expand E1–E4 → E1–E8: add untyped error surface (E5), log-without-rethrow (E6), no retry on transient failures (E7), unbounded retry (E8); STRUCTURED ERROR TYPES, OBSERVABILITY INTEGRATION, RETRY & RESILIENCE sections
- **feat(dlc-build/reviewer-prompts):** add 3 rows to Lens Selection table — error-handling, api-design, observability; add domain-specific Rule #7 to worker prompts
- **feat(dlc-review/teammate-prompts):** add Lens Selection table + `{domain_lenses}` placeholder; upgrade Teammate 2 with DRY/SOLID/performance patterns; upgrade Teammate 3 with NAMING, DOCUMENTATION, TESTABILITY, DEBUGGING guidance
- **feat(agents/code-reviewer):** upgrade to domain expert level — add 6 inline domain lenses (security, database, TypeScript, frontend, error handling, API design) with specific patterns and confidence thresholds per lens
- **feat(dlc-debug/dx-checklist):** expand 11 → 19 DX patterns: E5–E8 (error handling), O3–O6 (structured log context, PII, correlation ID, trace propagation), P5 (non-injectable dependency)
- **feat(dlc-debug/teammate-prompts):** upgrade Fix Reviewer SAFETY section — TOCTOU pattern, null paths, race conditions, error swallowing, type safety regression; correctness causal chain tracing
- **docs:** update CLAUDE.md Docs Index with review-lenses reference; update README with domain expert capabilities for dlc-build, dlc-review, dlc-debug, and code-reviewer agent

## [0.6.21] — 2026-03-23

### fix: post-audit accuracy — workflow phase references, CLAUDE.md, README

- **fix(dlc-review):** deduplicate Phase 0.05 rows in operational.md — split into 0.05A (pr-review-bootstrap) and 0.05B (Jira fetch concurrent)

- **fix(CLAUDE.md):** code-simplifier phase label corrected (Phase 5 → Phase 5.5); commands list updated to include `dlc-status` and `hook-test`
- **fix(README):** version badge updated to 0.6.20; Repo Structure expanded with 4 missing skills (careful, freeze, dlc-metrics, dlc-onboard); `dlc-metrics.jsonl` path corrected
- **fix(agents):** review-consolidator description updated to reflect iter 2+ usage
- **fix(dlc-build):** reference table updated — review-consolidator now shows iter 1 and iter 2+

## [0.6.20] — 2026-03-23

### Performance

- **dlc-review:** Phase 0 bootstrap and Jira fetch now run in parallel (saves 5–15s per review)
- **dlc-build Phase 1:** Explorer team spawns immediately while bootstrap runs concurrently (saves up to 60s in Full mode)
- **dlc-build Phase 2:** plan-challenger spawns speculatively during user think-time (saves one sequential round-trip)
