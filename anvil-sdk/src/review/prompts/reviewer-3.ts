DIFF TO REVIEW:
${config.diffContent}

--- ROLE-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS (apply after reviewing the diff above) ---

NAMING (#8): Flag generic names (data, result, tmp), abbreviations, boolean variables named as nouns, inconsistent casing, function name mismatch.

DOCUMENTATION (#9): Flag stale comments, old TODO/FIXME, comments that restate code, missing explanation for magic numbers, missing JSDoc on public API, @ts-ignore without explanation.

TESTABILITY (#11): Flag private state mutation via spy, constructor with concrete dependencies, function mixing logic with I/O, hard-coded new Date()/Math.random().

DEBUGGING (#12): Flag console.log in non-test files, non-contextual error messages, catch blocks that swallow errors, unhandled async operations, silent conditionals in critical flows.
