## Mode Check

ถ้า `--micro` หรือ `--focused` flag ระบุมา → **skip falsification** (ข้ามไปยัง Phase 6 โดยตรง).

# Phase 5: Convergence

## Falsification Pass (before consolidation)

**Spawn condition:**

- Normal/Large PRs → full falsification pass on all debate-surviving findings
- Massive PRs → lightweight falsification on Hard Rule findings only

**Try the SDK Falsifier first (faster, lower token cost):**

```bash
ENGINE_DIR="${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../devflow-engine"

if [ -d "$ENGINE_DIR" ] && [ -d "$ENGINE_DIR/node_modules" ]; then

  # Serialize surviving debate findings to a temp JSON file
  FINDINGS_FILE=$(mktemp /tmp/devflow-findings-XXXXXX.json)
  # Write findings as JSON array: [{"severity":"critical","rule":"...","file":"...","line":N,"confidence":N,"issue":"...","fix":"...","isHardRule":true}, ...]
  # echo '[...]' > "$FINDINGS_FILE"

  engine_result=$(cd "$ENGINE_DIR" && bun src/cli.ts falsify \
    --findings-file "$FINDINGS_FILE" \
    2>&1)
  engine_exit=$?
  rm -f "$FINDINGS_FILE"

else
  echo "devflow-engine not available — skipping SDK-enhanced analysis"
  engine_exit=1
fi
```

If `engine_exit=0` and `engine_result` is valid JSON (starts with `{`):

**Apply SDK verdicts directly:**

- Parse `engine_result.verdicts[]` — each has `findingIndex`, `verdict` (SUSTAINED/DOWNGRADED/REJECTED), `newSeverity?`, `rationale`
- REJECTED → remove finding; DOWNGRADED → update severity; SUSTAINED → pass through unchanged
- Report: `SDK Falsifier: {rejected} rejected · {downgraded} downgraded`
- **Skip Agent Teams `falsification-agent`** — proceed to `review-consolidator`

**If `engine_exit != 0` or not valid JSON**, log `engine falsify failed (exit {engine_exit}) — falling back to Agent Teams` and continue:

**Agent Teams fallback:** Spawn `falsification-agent` (defined in `agents/falsification-agent.md`) with the surviving debate findings table inline. The agent challenges each finding on three grounds and returns SUSTAINED / DOWNGRADED / REJECTED verdicts.

Apply verdicts before dispatching `review-consolidator`:

- REJECTED → remove from table
- DOWNGRADED → update severity (e.g., Critical → Warning)
- SUSTAINED → pass through unchanged

Note rejected count in output summary: `(N findings rejected by Falsification Pass)`.

Dispatch `review-consolidator` agent with the surviving debate findings passed inline in
the prompt. Capture the agent's output as the consolidated findings table.

If agent errors → perform dedup, pattern-cap, sort, and signal-check inline per
[review-conventions](../../df-review-conventions/SKILL.md).

Output the consolidated findings table per [review-output-format](../../df-review-output-format/SKILL.md).

**Confirmed Findings Log:** After consolidation, append Critical and Warning findings that survived falsification to `{review_memory_dir}/review-confirmed.md` (cap 30 FIFO). Format:

| Date | Finding | File:Line | Severity | Source | Workflow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | {brief} | {file}:{line} | Critical/Warning | PR #{number} | review |

These become positive severity anchors in future reviews (Step 1).

**Dismissed Findings Log:** After consolidation, append dropped findings to `{review_memory_dir}/review-dismissed.md` (cap 50 FIFO). Use this canonical format:

| Date | Finding | File:Line | Reason | Source | Workflow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YYYY-MM-DD | {brief} | {file}:{line} | {reason} | PR #{number} | review |

Replace the "Agents" column with "Consensus":

✅ **Good** — specific file+line, actionable issue, consensus recorded:

```markdown
**Summary: Critical 1 / Warning 2 / Info 0** (after debate)

#### Findings

| # | Sev | Rule | File | Line | Consensus | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Critical | #2 | `src/auth/user.service.ts` | 42 | 3/3 | Uses `as any` to bypass user type — add `isUser()` type guard |
| 2 | Warning | #5 | `src/auth/user.service.ts` | 78 | 2/3 | Nested ternary (depth 3) — extract to `resolveUserStatus()` |
| 3 | Warning | #8 | `src/utils/format.ts` | 12 | 3/3 | `data` is ambiguous — rename to `userPayload` |
```

❌ **Bad** — no file path, no line number, vague issue, no consensus:

```markdown
#### Findings

| # | Sev | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Critical | Bad typing |
| 2 | Warning | Nested code |
```
