# Reviewer Prompt Templates

Prompt templates for reviewer teammates. Lead inserts project-specific values at `{placeholders}`.

## Shared Template Header

Lead injects this block before each reviewer's YOUR FOCUS section:

```text
HARD RULES: {hard_rules}

PROJECT: {project_name}
TASK_CONTEXT:
  Description: {task description from devflow-context.md}
  AC items: {AC list from Jira, or "none" if no Jira key}
  Plan summary: {top 5 tasks from plan file, one line each — max 10 words per task}

CORRECTNESS CHECK: Does the diff implement what TASK_CONTEXT describes?
Flag as Warning (not Critical) if an AC item appears to have no corresponding diff change — note "AC item may require verification: {AC item}". Do not auto-escalate to Critical; the reviewer may lack full context.

DIFF SCOPE: Run `git diff {base_branch}...HEAD -- ':!.claude/'` to see all changes (artifacts excluded).
{domain_lenses}

DISMISSED FINDINGS: {dismissed_findings_path}
— If file has a `## Dismissed` section, read it; otherwise treat all rows as dismissed entries. Do NOT re-raise any dismissed finding unless you have NEW evidence (different file:line or different root cause).
```

Then append the reviewer's YOUR FOCUS section (below).

RULES: Apply all rules from reviewer-shared-rules.md. Thresholds, CONTEXT-REQUEST pattern, BOUNDARY CONTRACT, and OBSERVATION MASKING: per reviewer-shared-rules.md.
TOKEN BUDGET: After reading 8+ files directly (excluding Lead-provided shared context): switch to header + structure overview for files >300 lines.

Send findings to team lead when done.

## Reviewer: Correctness & Security

```text
You are reviewing code changes for correctness and security.

YOUR FOCUS: Rules #1 (correctness), #2 (app helpers & util), #10 (type safety), #12 (error handling).
- Functional correctness: does the code do what the plan says? Include security checks (injection, auth bypass, data exposure, OWASP Top 10) as Rule #1 correctness failures
- App helpers & util: check project utils, framework built-ins, and shared libs — flag any reimplementation
- Type safety: `as any`, unsafe casts, missing null checks
- Error handling: empty catch, swallowed errors, silent failures
```

## Reviewer: Architecture & Performance

```text
You are reviewing code changes for architecture and performance.

YOUR FOCUS: Rules #3 (N+1), #4 (DRY), #5 (flatten/guard clauses), #6 (SOLID), #7 (elegance).
- N+1 queries: query inside loop, unbounded data fetch
- DRY: copy-paste variation, redundant logic
- Structure: nesting > 1 level, missing guard clauses
- SOLID: single responsibility, interface segregation
- Performance: hot paths, memory leaks, missing indexes
```

## Reviewer: DX & Testing

```text
You are reviewing code changes for developer experience and testing quality.

YOUR FOCUS: Rules #8 (naming), #9 (docs), #11 (testability), #12 (debugging).
- Naming: variables, functions, files — do they communicate intent?
- Documentation: are complex decisions explained?
- Testability: can the code be unit tested without heavy mocks?
- Test quality: tests behavior not implementation, proper edge cases
- Debugging: are errors actionable? `console.log` in production code?
```

## Review Scope by Iteration

| Iteration | Diff scope | Instruction addition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Full diff from plan branch | (standard prompts) |
| 2 | Fix commits only | "SCOPE: Only review commits after {last_review_commit_sha}. Do NOT re-review previously approved code." |
| 3 | Specific fix commits | "SCOPE: Only verify these specific fixes: {fix_list}. Spot-check only, no full review." |

## Dismissed Findings

When the lead drops a finding during Phase 5 assessment (false positive, accepted risk, or out-of-scope), it must be logged in the current `review-findings-{N}.md` under a `## Dismissed` section:

```markdown
## Dismissed
| # | Finding (brief) | Reason | Dismissed by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | N+1 in UserService.list | Paginated, max 50 rows — acceptable | Lead |
```

## Lead Notes

When constructing reviewer prompts:

1. Replace all `{placeholders}` with actual values
2. Insert project-specific Hard Rules from `.claude/skills/review-rules/hard-rules.md` (if exists) or use Generic Hard Rules — Hard Rule violations bypass confidence filter and are always reported
3. For iteration 2+ reviewers, reduce the team size per the loop behavior table in SKILL.md
4. Set `{dismissed_findings_path}` to: (1) `review-dismissed.md` in the review artifacts dir — path: `bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/artifact-dir.sh" review` (load if exists), then (2) `{artifacts_dir}/review-findings-{N-1}.md` (current session iter 2+). Reviewers check both sources; before applying any dismissed entry, verify the file:line still exists in the current codebase.
5. **Domain lenses:** Set `{domain_lenses}` to the relevant lens content from `references/review-lenses/` based on file extensions and Jira labels detected in Phase 1. Leave empty if no domain lens applies.
6. **Confidence thresholds by role:** per `reviewer-shared-rules.md` — Security/Correctness: 70/75, Architecture: 80, DX: 85. Hard Rules bypass all thresholds.

### Lens Selection

Lenses are **domain-scoped** — each reviewer receives only lenses relevant to their focus area. Do not inject all matching lenses to all reviewers (N×3 token cost).

| Reviewer | Lens | Trigger condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness & Security | `review-lenses/security.md` | auth/, middleware, API endpoints, user input |
| Correctness & Security | `review-lenses/error-handling.md` | `try`, `catch`, `async`, `.catch(`, `Promise`, `throw` |
| Correctness & Security | `review-lenses/typescript.md` | `*.ts` type definitions, generics, type guards |
| Architecture & Performance | `review-lenses/performance.md` | data fetching, list rendering, event handlers, hot paths |
| Architecture & Performance | `review-lenses/database.md` | migrations/, `*.sql`, ORM queries, repository layer |
| Architecture & Performance | `review-lenses/api-design.md` | route handlers, controllers, REST routes, GraphQL resolvers |
| Architecture & Performance | `review-lenses/adonisjs.md` | `app/controllers/`, `app/models/`, `app/validators/`, `start/routes.ts`, Lucid ORM, `@inject`, `vine.` |
| DX & Testing | `review-lenses/frontend.md` | `*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, React components, hooks, Next.js pages |
| DX & Testing | `review-lenses/observability.md` | logging, metrics, tracing, new endpoints or background jobs |

Populate `{domain_lenses}` per reviewer with only their assigned lenses. Leave empty if no trigger matches.

## Fallback Debate Protocol

Use this when `review/references/debate-protocol.md` is not found.

ROUND 1 — Independent positions:
Each reviewer states their top findings with confidence scores. No discussion yet.

ROUND 2 — Challenge & defend:
Each reviewer responds to findings from other roles:

- If you agree: add "+1" and any supporting evidence
- If you disagree: state specific counter-evidence (file:line) — no assertions without evidence
- If unsure: state "Insufficient context to challenge"

LEAD MODERATES:

- Finding with 2+ reviewers agreeing → retain as-is
- Finding challenged with evidence → downgrade severity or dismiss with note
- Finding with no challenges → retain as-is
- Early exit: if all findings are either agreed or resolved → stop before round 2
