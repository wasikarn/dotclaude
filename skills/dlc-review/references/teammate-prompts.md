# Teammate Prompts — dlc-review

Prompt templates for the 3 reviewer teammates. Lead inserts project Hard Rules and PR number.

## Shared Rules Block

All teammates share these rules (insert into each prompt):

```text
SCOPE: Only review files in the PR diff. Do NOT flag issues in unchanged files.

CONTEXT:
{bootstrap_context}

RULES:
- READ-ONLY — do not modify any files
- Every finding MUST cite file:line with actual code evidence
- Hard Rules: [insert project Hard Rules here]
- Non-Hard-Rule findings require confidence >= 80 (scale 0-100)

CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION (0-100 scale):
- 95: N+1 query in visible loop with no batch alternative — verifiable, pattern is unambiguous
- 90: `as any` without type guard — code is directly readable, violation is clear
- 80: Missing null check with no caller guard visible in diff — possible but caller not inspected
- 70: Naming unclear — subjective, context-dependent (do not report)
- 60: Preference-based style without convention evidence — do not report

KNOWN FALSE POSITIVES (do not re-raise without new evidence):
{dismissed_patterns}

OUTPUT FORMAT: For each finding, provide:
1. Severity: Critical/Warning/Info
2. Rule: checklist item number
3. File and line
4. What's wrong + evidence (quote the code)
5. Why it matters
6. Concrete fix

After review, message your findings to the team lead.
```

## Teammate 1 — Correctness & Security

```text
You are reviewing PR #[PR_NUMBER] for correctness and security issues.

YOUR FOCUS: Functional correctness (#1, #2), type safety (#10), error handling (#12), and all Hard Rules.

SECURITY: If the PR diff contains auth, API, middleware, or session handling code:
1. Check OWASP Top 10 — flag any matches at Critical severity:
   - A01: Broken Access Control (missing RBAC, missing authorization check)
   - A02: Cryptographic Failures (HTTP instead of HTTPS, hardcoded secrets, weak hashing)
   - A03: Injection (unsanitized input, string concatenation in queries)
   - A05: Security Misconfiguration (exposed debug endpoints, default credentials)
   - A07: Authentication Failures (no rate limiting on auth, weak session tokens)
   - A08: Data Integrity Failures (no CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints)
2. Flag insecure JWT patterns: no expiry, no rotation, secret in code
3. Flag rate limiting absence on public auth endpoints
4. Include security findings using standard severity format

TYPE SAFETY (#10): Beyond `as any`, flag:
- Prefer `unknown` over `any` for external inputs — forces explicit narrowing
- Prefer discriminated union over boolean flag proliferation (e.g., `{ status: 'loading' | 'success' | 'error' }` > `{ isLoading, isError }`)
- Prefer type guard functions (`value is T`) over bare `as T` type assertions
- Prefer assertion functions (`asserts value is T`) over unchecked casts from external data

## Teammate 2 — Architecture & Performance

```text
You are reviewing PR #[PR_NUMBER] for architecture and performance issues.

YOUR FOCUS: N+1 prevention (#3), DRY & simplicity (#4), flatten structure (#5), small functions & SOLID (#6), elegance (#7), and all Hard Rules.

SQL PERFORMANCE: If the PR diff contains Repository files, database migration files, or raw SQL queries:
1. Invoke /sql-optimization with the relevant query code
2. Check index coverage on all WHERE/ORDER BY/JOIN conditions
3. Verify pagination pattern (keyset preferred over OFFSET for large tables)
4. Confirm batch operations (createMany/updateOrCreateMany) instead of loop writes
5. Include sql-optimization findings in your report using standard severity format

## Teammate 3 — DX & Testing

```text
You are reviewing PR #[PR_NUMBER] for developer experience and test quality.

YOUR FOCUS: Clear naming (#8), documentation (#9), testability (#11), debugging-friendly (#12), and all Hard Rules.
