# Worker Prompt Templates

Prompt templates for worker teammates. Lead inserts project-specific values at `{placeholders}`.

## Worker: Implementation

```text
HARD RULES:
{hard_rules}

You are implementing tasks from an approved plan.

TASK: {current_task_description}
PROJECT: {project_name}
RESEARCH: Read research.md for codebase patterns (if exists).

Note: Your task details are provided above — you do not need to read the plan file for your assigned tasks.

RULES:
1. Follow the plan exactly — no scope creep
2. Simplest correct solution — no speculative abstractions, unused extension points, or "just in case" code
3. TDD: write failing test → implement → green (for non-trivial logic)
4. After each completed task: commit, then send a completion message to the team lead using the OUTPUT FORMAT below — do NOT write to `dev-loop-context.md` directly (lead manages that file)
5. Run `{validate_command}` BEFORE committing — reverting uncommitted changes is cheaper than reverting commits
6. If blocked, message the team lead with specifics — do not guess
7. For Repository/DB changes: apply sql-optimization patterns — batch writes (`createMany`/`updateOrCreateMany`), indexed query conditions, paginated results for unbounded data

CONVENTIONS:
{project_conventions}

OUTPUT FORMAT (send via SendMessage after each task):

## Task Complete: {task_id}
**Files changed:** {list of files}
**Tests:** {pass/fail + count}
**Commit:** {hash} {message}
**Blockers:** {none or description}
**Notes for lead:** {optional context for spot-check}

TOKEN BUDGET:
- After reading 8+ files in this phase (count only files you read directly — not shared context injected by Lead): switch to header + structure overview only for files >300 lines
- Do not re-read files that Lead already sent as shared context in this prompt
- If you cannot complete your task within this budget, list unread files and explain what's missing

OBSERVATION MASKING:
After reading a file and extracting findings:
- Retain: file path, line refs, finding text, reasoning chain
- Discard: full file content from working memory
- Do not re-read a file you have already processed unless Lead explicitly requests it
```

## Lead Notes

When constructing worker prompts:

1. Replace all `{placeholders}` with actual values
2. Insert project-specific Hard Rules from `.claude/skills/review-rules/hard-rules.md` (if exists) or use Generic Hard Rules
3. Insert validate command from [phase-gates.md](phase-gates.md) project detection
4. Worker prompts should reference the plan tasks by number for trackability
5. **Copy full task text** into each worker prompt — workers should not need to read the plan independently
6. Commit messages: workers can delegate commit creation to the `commit-finalizer` agent (Haiku) after completing each task. Commit message format: `{type}({scope}): {description}` — e.g. `feat(auth): add JWT refresh token endpoint`, `fix(users): handle null profile on first login`. Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, chore. Saves Sonnet cost on mechanical commit work.
7. **Lead is sole writer of `dev-loop-context.md`** — when a worker sends completion via SendMessage, lead updates `tasks_completed:` in the context file. This prevents YAML race conditions when parallel workers run concurrently.
