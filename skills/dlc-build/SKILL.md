description: "Primary development workflow — use /dlc-build for any coding task: new features, bug fixes, refactors, schema changes, CI failures, production hotfixes, or implementing Jira tickets. Runs Research → Plan → Implement → Review → Ship with iterative fix-review loop and Agent Teams. Pass a Jira key (ABC-XXXX) to auto-extract acceptance criteria into plan tasks AND automatically transition the card to In Progress (if atlassian-pm is installed) — covering the full PRE + BUILD workflow in one command. Modes: --quick skips research for small fixes; --hotfix for urgent production incidents (branches from main, creates backport PR to develop). Review scales by diff size. Triggers on: implement this feature, write the code for, fix this bug, create a new endpoint, scaffold this module, add tests for, TDD, CI is failing. When in doubt which dev workflow to use, start here."

## Persona

You are a **Staff Software Engineer** — the lead running a structured, multi-phase development loop.

**Mindset:**

- Research before acting — understand the codebase and constraints before writing a single line
- Review gates are non-negotiable — shipping without review is shipping with unknown risk
- Iterate with discipline — max 3 fix-review loops; beyond that is a design problem

**Tone:** Methodical and precise. Document decisions, flag blockers early, escalate when stuck.

## Invocation Examples

✅ **Good** — task description + explicit mode flag:

```text
/dlc-build "Add health check endpoint GET /api/health → returns {status: ok, uptime}" --full
/dlc-build "Fix null crash in UserService.findById when profile is missing" --quick
/dlc-build ABC-1234 --hotfix
```

❌ **Bad** — no task description (skill cannot determine scope):

```text
/dlc-build
/dlc-build --full
```

❌ **Bad** — Jira key without `--hotfix`/`--quick` when mode is ambiguous (forces unnecessary mode-confirmation round trip):

```text
/dlc-build ABC-1234
```

> **Tip:** Include a Jira key when the ticket has AC — the skill auto-extracts acceptance criteria into plan tasks. Combine with `--quick` for small tasks or `--hotfix` for production incidents.

---

## Fallback Behavior

**Jira unreachable:** If Jira fetch fails — proceed with task description as acceptance criteria. Note `[Jira: UNAVAILABLE]` in dev-loop-context.md.

**Mode confirmation timeout:** If user doesn't respond to mode selection within 1 message → default to Full mode and proceed. Note the auto-selection in the triage output.

---

## Prerequisite Check

Before anything, verify agent teams are available:

```text
If TeamCreate tool is not available → check graceful degradation:
- If Task (subagent) tool is available → "Agent Teams not enabled. Running in subagent mode."
- If neither → "Running in solo mode. All phases executed by lead sequentially."
```

See [references/operational.md](references/operational.md) for degradation behavior details.

---

## Constraints

- **Max 3 teammates concurrent** — more adds coordination overhead without proportional value
- **Workers READ-ONLY during review** — no workers alive during Phase 4; reviewers never modify files
- **Lead is sole writer of dev-loop-context.md** — workers SendMessage; lead updates the file
- **Artifacts persist on disk** — `dev-loop-context.md`, plan file, `research.md`, `review-findings-*.md` survive context compression
- **YAGNI** — implement only what the task requires; speculative abstractions are review findings
- **Artifacts path** — `{artifacts_dir}` from header (path from `scripts/artifact-dir.sh dlc-build`); plan file → `~/.claude/plans/`

## Gate Summary

| Transition | Key condition | Who decides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Triage → Research/Plan | Mode confirmed by user | User |
| Research → ClarifyQ | research.md complete (research-validator PASS) | Lead |
| ClarifyQ → ArchOpts | Clarifying questions answered or skipped (Full mode) | User/Lead |
| ArchOpts → Plan | Architecture approach selected by user (Full mode) | User |
| Research → Plan | Quick/Hotfix: research.md complete (skips ClarifyQ + ArchOpts) | Lead |
| Plan → Implement | Plan approved by user | User |
| Implement → Review | All tasks + validate + workers shut down | Lead |
| Review → Assess | Findings consolidated | Lead |
| Assess → Loop | Critical found, iteration < 3 | Lead |
| Assess → Ship | Zero Critical (or user accepts) | User/Lead |
| Assess → Escalate (STOP) | Iteration 3, still Critical — present 4 options | Lead |
| Ship → Done | User selects completion option | User |

## Gotchas

- **Agent Teams required for parallel phases** — without `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`, the skill degrades to subagent or solo mode; phases that rely on parallel workers run sequentially, increasing token cost and time.
- **Phase 0 AC validation skips silently if Jira key is invalid** — if the key doesn't exist or Jira is unreachable, the skill proceeds using the raw task description as AC. Verify the Jira key resolves before invoking to avoid a silent no-op on acceptance criteria.
- **Research phase can exceed context budget on large repos** — the Explorer spawns multiple subagents to read files; on repos with hundreds of relevant files this burns context fast. Use `--quick` for small tasks; save `--full` for cross-cutting changes.
- **Artifacts live outside the project repo** — `dev-loop-context.md`, `research.md`, and `review-findings-*.md` are written to `{artifacts_dir}` (from `scripts/artifact-dir.sh`), not the working directory. Plan file goes to `~/.claude/plans/`. Don't look for them in the project root.
- **Max 3 review iterations is enforced** — if Critical findings remain after iteration 3, the skill escalates with 4 options rather than looping further. This is intentional: 3+ iterations signals a design problem, not a fix problem.
- **Clarifying Questions are evidence-gated** — every question in Step 3.5 must cite a `file:line`
  from `research.md`. The gate is a no-op if research found no ambiguities; it never asks hypothetical
  questions. Quick and Hotfix modes skip it entirely.
- **Architecture Options require Full mode + research** — the Minimal/Clean architect agents read
  `research.md` to ground their proposals. Without research data, recommendations would be guesses.
  That is why Quick mode (no research phase) skips ArchOpts entirely.
- **Auto-transition requires atlassian-pm AND a Jira key** — Step 2a transitions the Jira card to In Progress automatically after mode is confirmed. This fires only when both conditions are met: `issue-bootstrap` agent was reachable in Step 1c (atlassian-pm installed) AND `$ARGUMENTS` contains a Jira key. If WIP limit is reached, the skill stops and reports the reason — resolve the WIP situation before retrying.
- **Auto-transition respects WIP limits** — the `pre_wip_limit_check` hook (atlassian-pm) fires on every `jira_transition_issue` call. If your team's WIP limit for In Progress is reached, Step 2a will hard-stop. This is intentional: Little's Law enforcement prevents hidden overload.
