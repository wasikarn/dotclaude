name: dlc-build
description: "Primary development workflow — use /dlc-build for any coding task: new features, bug fixes, refactors, schema changes, CI failures, production hotfixes, or implementing Jira tickets. Runs Research → Plan → Implement → Review → Ship with iterative fix-review loop and Agent Teams. Pass a Jira key (BEP-XXXX) to auto-extract acceptance criteria into plan tasks. Modes: --quick skips research for small fixes; --hotfix for urgent production incidents (branches from main, creates backport PR to develop). Review scales by diff size. Triggers on: implement this feature, write the code for, fix this bug, create a new endpoint, scaffold this module, add tests for, TDD, CI is failing. When in doubt which dev workflow to use, start here."

# Team Dev Loop — Full Development Workflow

Invoke as `/dlc-build [task-description-or-jira-key] [--quick?] [--full?] [--hotfix?]`

**Task:** $ARGUMENTS | **Today:** !`date +%Y-%m-%d`
**Git branch:** !`git branch --show-current`
**Recent commits:** !`git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null || true`
**Project:** !`bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/detect-project.sh" 2>/dev/null || true`
**Artifacts dir:** !`bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/artifact-dir.sh" dlc-build "$0" 2>/dev/null || echo ""`

**Args:** `$0`=task description or Jira key (required) · `$1`=`--quick` · `$1`=`--full` · `$1`=`--hotfix`

## Phase Flow

Phase 0→1→2→ [3: Implement ↔ 4: Review ↔ 5: Assess loop (max 3)] →6: Ship

| Iter | Implement | Reviewers | Debate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Full plan | 3 | Full (2 rounds max, early-exit at 90% consensus) |
| 2 | Fix findings | 2 | Focused (1 round) |
| 3 | Remaining fixes | 1 | None (spot-check only) |

## Invocation Examples

✅ **Good** — task description + explicit mode flag:

```text
/dlc-build "Add health check endpoint GET /api/health → returns {status: ok, uptime}" --full
/dlc-build "Fix null crash in UserService.findById when profile is missing" --quick
/dlc-build BEP-1234 --hotfix
```

❌ **Bad** — no task description (skill cannot determine scope):

```text
/dlc-build
/dlc-build --full
```

❌ **Bad** — Jira key without `--hotfix`/`--quick` when mode is ambiguous (forces unnecessary mode-confirmation round trip):

```text
/dlc-build BEP-1234
```

> **Tip:** Include a Jira key when the ticket has AC — the skill auto-extracts acceptance criteria into plan tasks. Combine with `--quick` for small tasks or `--hotfix` for production incidents.

---

## Fallback Behavior

**Jira unreachable:** If Jira fetch fails — proceed with task description as acceptance criteria. Note `[Jira: UNAVAILABLE]` in dev-loop-context.md.

**Mode confirmation timeout:** If user doesn't respond to mode selection within 1 message → default to Full mode and proceed. Note the auto-selection in the triage output.

---

## Prerequisite Check

Before anything, verify agent teams are available:

```text
If TeamCreate tool is not available → check graceful degradation:
- If Task (subagent) tool is available → "Agent Teams not enabled. Running in subagent mode."
- If neither → "Running in solo mode. All phases executed by lead sequentially."
```

See [references/operational.md](references/operational.md) for degradation behavior details.

---

## Constraints

- **Max 3 teammates concurrent** — more adds coordination overhead without proportional value
- **Workers READ-ONLY during review** — no workers alive during Phase 4; reviewers never modify files
- **Lead is sole writer of dev-loop-context.md** — workers SendMessage; lead updates the file
- **Artifacts persist on disk** — `dev-loop-context.md`, plan file, `research.md`, `review-findings-*.md` survive context compression
- **YAGNI** — implement only what the task requires; speculative abstractions are review findings
- **Artifacts path** — `{artifacts_dir}` from header (path from `scripts/artifact-dir.sh dlc-build`); plan file → `~/.claude/plans/`

## Gate Summary

| Transition | Key condition |
| --- | --- |
| Triage → Research/Plan | Mode confirmed by user |
| Research → Plan | research.md complete with file:line evidence |
| Plan → Implement | Plan approved by user |
| Implement → Review | All tasks + validate + workers shut down |
| Review → Assess | Findings consolidated |
| Assess → Loop | Critical found, iteration < 3 |
| Assess → Ship | Zero Critical (or user accepts) |
| Assess → Escalate (STOP) | Iteration 3, still Critical — present 4 options |
| Ship → Done | User selects completion option |
