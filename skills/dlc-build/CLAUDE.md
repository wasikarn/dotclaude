# dlc-build skill

Full development loop with Agent Teams: Research → Plan → Implement → Review → Ship.
Uses dynamic team roster (explorers, workers, reviewers) with iterative implement-review loop.

## How It Differs from Other DLC Skills

| Aspect | dlc-review | dlc-build | dlc-debug |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | PR review + debate | Full dev loop | Debug + DX harden |
| Execution | 3 teammates (debate) | Dynamic roster per phase | Investigator + DX Analyst + Fixer |
| Review | Adversarial debate | Embedded (reuses dlc-review pattern) | N/A (no review phase) |
| Loop | None | Implement-Review (max 3 iter) | Fix-only (max 3 attempts) |
| Artifacts | Findings in output | research.md, plan.md, review-findings-N.md | debug-context.md, investigation.md |

## Skill Architecture

- `SKILL.md` — overview, phase flow, reference table, constraints, gate summary (~100 lines)
- `references/phase-{1-9}-*.md` — phase-specific instructions (load on demand)
- Role-specific prompt files: explorer, worker, fixer, reviewer
- `references/review-lenses/` — domain checklists injected into reviewer prompts at Phase 6
- `references/phase-gates.md` — gate conditions for every phase transition
- `references/explorer-prompts.md`, `references/worker-prompts.md`, `references/fixer-prompts.md`, `references/reviewer-prompts.md` — role-specific prompt templates
- `references/workflow-modes.md` — Mode Capability Matrix (Micro/Quick/Full/Hotfix), blast-radius scoring, PhaseVerdict schema
- Reuses `dlc-review` pattern for Phase 6 Stage 2 (review + debate)
- Project-specific Hard Rules loaded from `.claude/skills/review-rules/hard-rules.md` in the target project

## Validate After Changes

```bash
# Lint all markdown in this skill
npx markdownlint-cli2 "skills/dlc-build/**/*.md"

# Verify skill symlink exists
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/dlc-build

# Test invocation (requires CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1):
# /dlc-build "Add health check endpoint" --full
# /dlc-build "Fix null check in UserService" --quick
# /dlc-build "ABC-1234 production crash" --hotfix
```

## Gotchas

- Requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` — degrades gracefully to subagent or solo mode
- Agent Teams have no session resumption — if lead crashes, artifacts on disk enable manual recovery
- Workers and reviewers are never alive simultaneously — workers during Phase 4, reviewers during Phase 6
- Review scope narrows each iteration: 3 reviewers → 2 → 1, full debate → focused → spot-check
- Hard Rules cannot be dropped via debate — only reclassified with evidence
- Max 3 loop iterations enforced — prevents runaway token usage
- Artifacts written to **`{artifacts_dir}/{date}-{slug}/`** (path from `scripts/artifact-dir.sh dlc-build`): `dev-loop-context.md`, `research.md`, `plan.md`, `verify-results.md`, `review-findings-*.md`. All artifacts in one folder — `~/.claude/plans/` is no longer used.
- Team cleanup must be done by lead in Phase 9 — teammates don't self-terminate
- One team per session — cannot run multiple dlc-build in parallel
