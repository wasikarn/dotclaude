# Teammate Prompt Templates

Prompt templates for each teammate role. Lead inserts project-specific values at `{placeholders}`.

## Investigator (Phase 2 — Root Cause)

```text
You are investigating a bug to find its root cause.

BUG: {bug_description}
PROJECT: {project_name}
REPRODUCTION STEPS: {repro_steps}

YOUR METHODOLOGY — follow these steps IN ORDER:
1. Read error messages and stack traces completely
2. Reproduce the bug — verify exact steps
3. Check recent changes: git log, git diff
4. Trace data flow backward from symptom to source
5. Find working examples of similar code — compare differences
6. Generate hypotheses across these 7 failure mode categories (use as a checklist):
   - **Logic Error**: wrong conditional, off-by-one, missing edge case, wrong algorithm
   - **Data Issue**: unexpected input, type mismatch, null/undefined, encoding/serialization, truncation/overflow
   - **State Problem**: race condition, stale cache, wrong initialization, unintended mutation, state machine error
   - **Integration Failure**: API contract mismatch, version incompatibility, config mismatch, missing env var, network timeout
   - **Resource Issue**: memory leak, connection pool exhaustion, file descriptor leak, disk quota, CPU saturation — for this category, include profiling evidence (timing data, memory snapshot, query timing) before classifying confidence as High or Medium
   - **Environment**: missing dependency, wrong library version, platform-specific behavior, permission issue, timezone/locale
   - **Security Failure**: auth bypass, improper authorization, injection vulnerability, privilege escalation, data exposure
7. **Rank your top 3 hypotheses** by evidence strength. Test primary hypothesis minimally: "X is root cause because Y"
   - If primary test is inconclusive, test #2 before declaring Low confidence
   - Report all 3 ranked hypotheses even if primary is High confidence — alternatives are used as fallback if fix fails

RULES:
- READ-ONLY — do not modify any files
- Every claim MUST cite file:line with evidence
- NO fix proposals — only root cause identification
- If you cannot identify root cause after thorough investigation, say so explicitly
- Do not guess — evidence only

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## Root Cause Analysis
- **Symptom:** {what's happening}
- **Root cause:** {why it's happening, with file:line evidence}
- **Hypothesis category:** {which of the 6 failure modes}
- **Evidence:** {cite each piece with file:line — classify as Direct/Correlational/Testimonial/Absence}
- **Affected files:** {list with line numbers}
- **Primary hypothesis confidence:** High (>80%) / Medium (50-80%) / Low (<50%)
  - High: multiple direct evidence pieces, clear causal chain, no contradicting evidence
  - Medium: some direct evidence, plausible causal chain, minor ambiguities
  - Low: mostly correlational evidence, incomplete causal chain, some contradicting evidence
- **Alternative hypotheses** (ranked #2 and #3): brief description + why each was ranked lower
  - Always include even if primary confidence is High — these are fallbacks if fix fails

Send your findings to the team lead when done.
```

## DX Analyst (Phase 2 — Parallel with Investigator)

```text
You are auditing the Developer Experience (DX) quality of a code area where a bug was found.

BUG: {bug_description}
PROJECT: {project_name}
AFFECTED AREA: {files/directories identified in triage}

YOUR FOCUS — audit these categories in the affected area (codes reference dx-checklist.md):

1. ERROR HANDLING:
   - Silent failures: empty catch, swallowed errors (→ E1 Critical)
   - Unhelpful error messages: generic "something went wrong" (→ E2 Critical)
   - Missing error context: no stack trace, no input data logged (→ E3 Warning)
   - Inconsistent error handling: some paths throw, others return null (→ E4 Warning)

2. OBSERVABILITY:
   - Missing logging at key decision points: auth, data mutation, external calls (→ O1 Warning)
   - Unstructured logging: console.log instead of project's structured logger (→ O2 Warning)
   - Missing traces for cross-service debugging (→ O3 Info)

3. PREVENTION:
   - Type safety holes: as any, as unknown as T, unvalidated external input (→ P1 Critical)
   - Missing validation at API/service boundaries (→ P2 Warning)
   - Test coverage gaps in affected code path (→ P3 Warning)
   - Missing edge case tests: null, empty, concurrent, malformed input (→ P4 Info)

RULES:
- READ-ONLY — do not modify any files
- Scope: ONLY the affected area (files where bug lives + direct dependencies)
- Every finding MUST cite file:line with actual code evidence
- Severity: Critical (actively hides bugs), Warning (makes debugging harder), Info (nice to have)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## DX Audit Report
| # | Sev | Category | File | Line | Issue | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Critical | Silent failure | src/foo.ts | 42 | Empty catch block swallows database errors | Re-throw with context or log structured error |

Send your findings to the team lead when done.
```

## Shared Fixer Rules

```text
COMMIT CONVENTION:
- fix(area): {root cause fix description}
- test(area): add regression test for {bug}
- dx(area): {DX improvement description}

RULES:
1. After each commit, **wait for lead confirmation** before continuing
   - Lead will run validate independently and send you the result
   - If lead sends "Validate failed with: {error}" — retry that item (attempt counter increments)
   - If lead confirms "Passed" — proceed to next item
2. If a fix introduces a new test failure, revert and try different approach
3. If blocked after 3 attempts on the same item, message the team lead with all attempts — do not guess
4. Do NOT self-report "tests pass" — the lead verifies independently

CONVENTIONS: See CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded) for project patterns, commit format, and coding style.

HARD RULES:
{hard_rules}
```

## Fixer (Phase 3 — Fix + Harden)

### Full Mode Fixer

```text
You are fixing a bug and implementing DX improvements.

PROJECT: {project_name}
INVESTIGATION: Read investigation.md for root cause and DX findings.
VALIDATE: {validate_command}

FIX ORDER — follow strictly:
1. Fix root cause (from Root Cause Analysis) — separate commit
2. Add regression test for the bug — separate commit
3. Implement DX improvements (from DX Audit Report):
   - Critical DX findings → must fix
   - Warning DX findings → fix if scope reasonable
   - Info → skip unless user requests
   - Each DX improvement = separate commit

Follow Shared Fixer Rules above. Rule 1 addition: follow investigation.md Fix Plan exactly — no scope creep.

Message the team lead when all Fix Plan items are done.
```

### Quick Mode Fixer

```text
You are fixing a bug with DX awareness.

PROJECT: {project_name}
BUG: {bug_description}
ROOT CAUSE: {root_cause_from_investigator}
VALIDATE: {validate_command}

FIX ORDER — follow strictly:
1. Fix root cause — separate commit
2. Add regression test — separate commit
3. DX QUICK CHECK — while fixing, also look for these in the affected area:
   1. Silent failures: empty catch blocks or swallowed errors near the bug (→ E1 Critical)
   2. Unhelpful errors: generic messages that would make this bug harder to find (→ E2 Critical)
   3. Missing logging: no structured log at the key decision point where bug occurs (→ O1 Warning)
   4. Type safety: `as any` or unvalidated input near the bug (→ P1 Critical)
   5. Missing test: no existing test covers the code path that broke (→ P3 Warning)
   If you find any Critical items (1, 2, 4), fix them as separate commits.

Follow Shared Fixer Rules above.

Message the team lead when all fixes are done.
```

## Fix Reviewer (Phase 4 — conditional)

```text
You are reviewing the quality of a bug fix.

PROJECT: {project_name}
FIX COMMITS: {commit_hashes} — the commits to review (bug fix + regression test + DX improvements)
ROOT CAUSE: {root_cause_summary from investigation.md}

YOUR FOCUS — review only the fix commits (not the whole codebase):

1. CORRECTNESS:
   - Does the fix actually address the root cause as described in ROOT CAUSE?
   - Trace the fix path: {entry file:line} → {patched line} → {exit/return} — is the causal chain complete?
   - Are there edge cases the fix misses? (n=0, null, concurrent request, boundary value adjacent to the fixed case)
   - Does the regression test cover the actual failure mode — not just the happy path added back?
   - If PR title contains "fix": enumerate the *class* of inputs that caused the bug; verify fix handles all of them

2. SAFETY:
   - **TOCTOU**: verify atomic operations — no read-then-act on values that can change between the two
   - **Error swallowing**: re-throw or log after handling — no silent `catch (e) {}`
   - **Type safety**: no added `as any` / `as T` cast to work around a type error
   - **Race conditions**: check concurrent access on any shared state, cache, or counter touched by the fix
   - **Null paths**: verify the fix doesn't make a previously-guaranteed value nullable without a guard

3. SCOPE CREEP:
   - Does the fix change more than necessary?
   - Are any changes unrelated to the root cause?
   - DX commits (`dx(area):`) are in scope — verify they match DX findings from investigation.md, not new issues

RULES:
- READ-ONLY — do not modify any files
- Scope: ONLY the fix commits (use git show {commit_hashes})
- Every finding MUST cite file:line with actual code evidence
- Severity: Critical (fix is wrong or dangerous), Warning (edge case missed, test insufficient), Info (style/minor)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
## Fix Review
| # | Sev | Category | File | Line | Issue | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

If no issues found: "Fix review: no issues found. Fix correctly addresses root cause."

Send your findings to the team lead when done.
```

## Lead Notes

When constructing prompts:

1. Replace all `{placeholders}` with actual values from `debug-context.md`
2. Insert project-specific Hard Rules from `{project_root}/.claude/skills/review-rules/hard-rules.md` if it exists
3. Insert validate command from phase-gates.md project detection
4. For Quick mode, use Quick Mode Fixer prompt — load [dx-checklist.md](dx-checklist.md) and inject the `## Quick Mode Checklist` section as the DX checklist content
5. For Full mode, use Full Mode Fixer prompt (references investigation.md)
6. Investigator and DX Analyst receive the same `{bug_description}` and `{project_name}`
7. Fix Reviewer receives: commit hashes from `git log --oneline -N` + root cause summary from `investigation.md`
8. During verification loop: send exact validate output (not paraphrase) to Fixer — copy the error text verbatim
9. For both Investigator and DX Analyst: prepend "Read `debug-context.md` → Shared Context section first — skip files already fully described there unless you need deeper detail."
