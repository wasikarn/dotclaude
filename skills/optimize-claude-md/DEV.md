# optimize-claude-md skill

Audits, scores, and optimizes CLAUDE.md files for maximum agent effectiveness.
SKILL.md is the agent entry point; references/ provides supporting detail.

## Docs Index

Prefer reading before editing — key references:

| Reference | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `references/quality-criteria.md` | Updating scoring rubric or grade thresholds |
| `references/compression-guide.md` | Updating compression techniques |
| `references/key-rules.md` | Updating operational rules for Phase 4 |
| `references/templates.md` | Updating CLAUDE.md templates by project type |
| `scripts/pre-scan.sh` | Updating framework detection or file discovery logic |

## Skill Architecture

- `SKILL.md` — 5-phase workflow: Discovery → Score → Audit → Update → Verify
- `references/quality-criteria.md` — CLAUDE.md Quality rubric (8 criteria) + Project Coverage rubric (12 categories)
- `scripts/pre-scan.sh` — detects framework/scripts/structure in ~30ms; always run first in Phase 1
- Audit report written to `.claude/optimize-claude-md-report.md` — survives context compaction

## Validate After Changes

```bash
# Lint all markdown in this skill
npx markdownlint-cli2 "skills/optimize-claude-md/**/*.md"

# Verify skill symlink exists
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/optimize-claude-md

# Test pre-scan script
bash skills/optimize-claude-md/scripts/pre-scan.sh . | jq -c '.'

# Invoke skill:
# /optimize-claude-md            → full 5-phase audit + edits
# /optimize-claude-md --dry-run  → phases 1-3 only (report, no edits)
```

## Gotchas

- Run `/optimize-claude-md` when this file feels outdated
- This CLAUDE.md is **tracked in git** — changes here are shared with the team
- `pre-scan.sh` targets bash 3.x (macOS default) — no `declare -A`, no `mapfile`
- `stat -f%z` is macOS/BSD syntax for file size — GNU Linux uses `stat -c%s`
- Size measurement excludes auto-generated sections (`<claude-mem-context>`, plugin blocks) — score human-authored content only
- Two scores: CLAUDE.md Quality (content quality) + Project Coverage (feature adoption). Both use 100-point scales
- Project Coverage 100/100 is achievable for any project — scores only applicable features, not all 12 categories
