# /careful — Safe Mode Activated

Safe mode is now active for this session.

**Blocked commands:**

- `rm -rf` — recursive delete
- `DROP TABLE` — database destructive DDL
- `git push --force` — force push (overwrites remote history)
- `truncate` — wipe table data
- `git reset --hard` (on committed work)

To proceed with a blocked command, explicitly confirm: "I understand the risk, run `<command>` anyway."

To deactivate: start a new session or use `/uncareful` (if installed).

## Gotchas

- **Session-scoped only** — the hook activates for this session only; start a new session to deactivate.
- **Pattern matching is regex-based** — commands with unusual spacing or quoting may bypass the block.
  Use `/careful` as a reminder layer, not a security boundary.
- This skill only registers the hook — Claude will not summarize or explain the activation unless the hook itself returns a message.
