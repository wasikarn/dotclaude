**Task:** $ARGUMENTS | **Today:** !`date +%Y-%m-%d`
**Git branch:** !`git branch --show-current`
**Recent commits:** !`git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null`
**Project:** !`bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/detect-project.sh" 2>/dev/null`

**Args:** `$0`=task description or Jira key (required) · `$1`=`--quick` (optional, skip research)

Read CLAUDE.md first — auto-loaded, contains project patterns and conventions.

## Prerequisite Check

Before anything, verify agent teams are available:

```text
If TeamCreate tool is not available → check graceful degradation:
- If Task (subagent) tool is available → "Agent Teams not enabled. Running in subagent mode (no debate, no messaging)."
- If neither → "Running in solo mode. All phases executed by lead sequentially."
```

---

## Phase 0: Triage (Lead Only)

### Step 1: Detect Project

Use the `Project` JSON from the header (output of `detect-project.sh`). It contains: `project`, `repo`, `validate`, `review_skill`, `base_branch`, `branch`.

If `review_skill` is non-empty, load project-specific Hard Rules from the corresponding `tathep-*-review-pr` skill.

### Step 2: Classify Mode

Per [workflow-modes.md](references/workflow-modes.md):

- `--quick` flag or simple bug fix → **Quick mode** (skip Phase 1)
- Multi-file feature, architectural change → **Full mode**
- Ambiguous → ask user

### Step 2.5: Jira Context (skip if no Jira)

Scan `$ARGUMENTS` for Jira key (`BEP-\d+`). If found, follow [jira-integration.md](../../references/jira-integration.md) §team-dev-loop:

1. Fetch ticket → extract AC and subtasks
2. AC items become plan task constraints (Phase 2)
3. Add Jira context to `dev-loop-context.md` (Step 3)

If no Jira key → skip to Step 3.

### Step 3: Create Context Artifact

Write `dev-loop-context.md` at project root:

```markdown
# Dev Loop Context

Task: {task_description}
Mode: {Full|Quick}
Project: {project_name}
Validate: {validate_command}
Started: {date}
Branch: {branch_name}

## Hard Rules
{project_hard_rules}

## Jira Ticket (if provided)
{jira_context_or_empty}
```

### Step 4: Initialize Progress Tracker

```markdown
## Dev Loop: {TASK_NAME}
Mode: {mode} | Project: {project} | Started: {date}

- [x] Phase 0: Triage — {mode} mode, {project} detected
- [ ] Phase 1: Research [Full only]
- [ ] Phase 2: Plan
- [ ] Loop iteration 1/3
  - [ ] Phase 3: Implement
  - [ ] Phase 4: Review
  - [ ] Phase 5: Assess
- [ ] Phase 6: Ship
```

**GATE:** User confirms mode → proceed.

---

## Phase 1: Research (Full Mode Only)

Skip this phase entirely in Quick mode → go to Phase 2.

### Step 1: Create Explorer Team

Create team `dev-loop-{branch}` with 2-3 explorer teammates using prompts from [teammate-prompts.md](references/teammate-prompts.md):

- **Explorer 1:** Execution paths + patterns in primary area
- **Explorer 2:** Data model + dependencies + coupling
- **Explorer 3:** Reference implementations (spawn only if task area has similar existing features)

### Step 2: Wait for Explorers

All explorers must complete before proceeding. Track:

```markdown
### Phase 1: Research

| Explorer | Status | Files examined |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Execution Paths | ... | ... |
| Data Model | ... | ... |
| References | ... | ... |
```

### Step 3: Merge Findings

Lead merges all explorer findings into `research.md` at project root. Structure: trace execution paths, map data flow, document conventions, identify reusable code, note constraints. Every section must cite file:line references.

**GATE:** `research.md` complete with file:line evidence → proceed.

---

## Phase 2: Plan (Lead Only)

### Step 1: Write Plan

Create `plan.md` at project root. Source material:

- Full mode: `research.md` findings
- Quick mode: task description + CLAUDE.md conventions

Plan structure:

1. Problem statement
2. Approach with rationale
3. File-by-file changes
4. Trade-offs
5. Simplicity check — is this the simplest approach? Flag speculative features or abstractions not required by the task
6. Test strategy
7. Task list — tag each task `[P]` (parallelizable) or `[S]` (sequential)

### Step 2: Annotation Cycle

Present plan to user. User may correct, reject, add constraints, or redirect.
Write all corrections into `plan.md` `## Annotations` section.
Repeat until user approves.

**GATE:** User approves plan → proceed to Implement-Review Loop.

---

## Implement-Review Loop (Max 3 Iterations)

Core loop: Implement → Review → Assess → (loop or exit).
Review scope narrows each iteration. See [phase-gates.md](references/phase-gates.md) for gate details.

| Iter | Implement scope | Review scope | Reviewers | Debate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Full plan tasks | Full diff | 3 | Full (2 rounds max) |
| 2 | Fix findings only | Fix commits only | 2 | Focused (1 round) |
| 3 | Remaining fixes | Specific lines | 1 | None (spot-check) |

---

### Phase 3: Implement

#### Iteration 1: Full Implementation

Create 1-2 worker teammates using prompts from [teammate-prompts.md](references/teammate-prompts.md):

- `[S]` tasks: 1 worker, sequential
- `[P]` tasks: 2 workers with non-overlapping file assignments

Workers follow TDD: failing test → implement → green → commit.
Lead validates each commit against plan.

#### Iteration 2+: Fix Findings

Create 1 fixer teammate with the fixer prompt from [teammate-prompts.md](references/teammate-prompts.md).
Fixer receives ONLY unresolved findings from `review-findings-{N-1}.md`.
Fix order: Critical → Warning. Each fix = separate commit.

**If a fix introduces a NEW Critical:** fixer reverts the commit and messages lead.
Lead decides: try different approach or escalate.

**GATE:** All tasks done + validate command passes → proceed to Review.

---

### Phase 4: Review

#### Iteration 1: Full Review + Debate

Reuse team-review-pr pattern (see [teammate-prompts.md](references/teammate-prompts.md) for reviewer prompts):

1. Create 3 reviewer teammates (Correctness, Architecture, DX)
2. Independent review of full diff
3. Adversarial debate per [debate-protocol.md](../team-review-pr/references/debate-protocol.md)
4. Consolidate findings per [review-conventions.md](../../references/review-conventions.md)

#### Iteration 2: Focused Review

- 2 reviewers (Correctness + Architecture)
- Review ONLY commits after last review point
- 1 debate round max
- No DX review (scope too narrow)

#### Iteration 3: Spot-Check

- 1 reviewer (Correctness)
- Verify specific fixes only — no full review
- No debate
- Binary output: pass or fail with specific issues

### Review Output

Write findings to `review-findings-{iteration}.md`:

```markdown
# Review Findings — Iteration {N}

## Summary
Critical: X | Warning: Y | Info: Z

## Findings
| # | Sev | File | Line | Consensus | Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Critical | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

**GATE:** Findings consolidated → proceed to Assess.

---

### Phase 5: Assess (Lead Only)

Count findings from `review-findings-{N}.md`. If Jira ticket was provided, also verify AC coverage — each AC must have corresponding implementation + test. Unverified AC = Critical finding.

```text
Critical == 0 AND Warning == 0?
├→ Yes: EXIT LOOP → Phase 6: Ship
│
Critical == 0 AND Warning > 0?
├→ Ask user: "Fix warnings? (Y/N)"
│   ├→ Yes: LOOP (iteration++)
│   └→ No: EXIT LOOP → Phase 6: Ship
│
Critical > 0 AND iteration < 3?
├→ LOOP (iteration++)
│
Critical > 0 AND iteration == 3?
└→ STOP — escalate to user per phase-gates.md escalation protocol
```

Update progress tracker with iteration results:

```markdown
- [x] Loop iteration {N}/3
  - [x] Phase 3: Implement — {task_count} tasks
  - [x] Phase 4: Review — Critical: {X}, Warning: {Y}
  - [x] Phase 5: Assess — {LOOP|EXIT|STOP}
```

**GATE:** Loop decision made → proceed accordingly.

---

## Phase 6: Ship (Lead Only)

### Step 1: Present Summary

```markdown
## Implementation Complete

**Task:** {task_description}
**Mode:** {Full|Quick}
**Iterations:** {count}/3
**Final status:** Critical: 0, Warning: {Y}, Info: {Z}

### Iteration History
| Iter | Critical | Warning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | ... | ... | ... |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... |
```

### Step 2: Completion Options

Present options to user:

1. **Create PR** — auto-generate title + description from plan.md + review summary
2. **Merge to main** — squash merge current branch
3. **Keep branch** — leave as-is for manual review
4. **Restart loop** — return to Phase 3 with additional changes

### Step 3: Cleanup

1. Shut down all remaining teammates
2. Clean up the team
3. Optionally archive artifacts (`dev-loop-context.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md`, `review-findings-*.md`)

---

## Graceful Degradation

| Level | Available tools | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent Teams** | TeamCreate, SendMessage | Full workflow as described |
| **Subagent** | Task (Agent tool) | Same phases, but: explorers/workers/reviewers as subagents. No debate (can't message). Review = 7-agent parallel (existing tathep-*-review-pr pattern). |
| **Solo** | None (lead only) | Lead executes all phases sequentially. Research = lead explores. Review = self-review with checklist. Loop still applies. |

Detect at Phase 0 and inform user of mode.

---

## Context Compression Recovery

If session compacts mid-workflow, re-read in order:

1. `dev-loop-context.md` — task, mode, project, Hard Rules
2. `plan.md` — task list with checkmarks showing progress
3. Latest `review-findings-*.md` — current iteration findings (if in loop)
4. Progress tracker in conversation — iteration count and phase

---

## Constraints

- **Max 3 teammates concurrent** — more adds coordination overhead without proportional value
- **Max 3 loop iterations** — beyond 3 = architectural problem, not fixable by iteration
- **Max 2 debate rounds** per [debate-protocol.md](../team-review-pr/references/debate-protocol.md)
- **Workers are READ-ONLY during review** — no workers alive during Phase 4
- **Reviewers are READ-ONLY always** — no file modifications during review
- **Hard Rules cannot be dropped** — only reclassified with evidence
- **Commit per task** — enables clean revert if fix introduces regressions
- **Artifacts persist on disk** — `dev-loop-context.md`, `plan.md`, `research.md`, `review-findings-*.md` survive context compression
- **YAGNI** — implement only what the task requires; speculative abstractions and "just in case" code are review findings
