# Plugin QA

Run the QA check suite to verify all hooks, skills, and plugin structure are healthy.

Run this command now:

```bash
bash scripts/qa-check.sh 2>&1
```

Report findings:

1. List every check that **passed** ✓
2. List every check that **failed** ✗ with the specific error
3. List checks that were **skipped** and what tool to install to enable them
4. Conclude: "QA PASSED" or "QA FAILED — N issues need attention"

If any check failed, offer to fix each issue one by one.

## Common Failures and Fixes

| Failure | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Markdownlint errors | Run `npx markdownlint-cli2 --fix "**/*.md"` then re-check |
| `hooks.json` parse error | Validate JSON syntax in `hooks/hooks.json` |
| Missing symlink | Run `bash scripts/link-assets.sh` to re-link |
| `plugin validate` error | Check `plugin.json` manifest for required fields |
| shellcheck warnings | Fix the flagged shell script lines — warnings = real bugs |

If all checks pass but behavior is still broken: restart Claude Code (hooks load at session start, not dynamically).
