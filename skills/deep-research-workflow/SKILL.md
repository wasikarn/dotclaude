description: "Structured Research → Plan → Implement workflow for features that touch multiple files or require deep codebase understanding before coding. Use this skill whenever the user says 'research first', 'understand the codebase', 'plan before coding', 'I don't want to jump to code', or starts a complex feature without a clear implementation path. Also use when the task involves unfamiliar modules, multiple valid approaches, or risk of breaking existing patterns — a written plan prevents wrong assumptions from compounding into broken implementations."

# /deep-research-workflow

Structured 3-phase workflow: Research → Plan → Implement. All creative decisions happen before implementation begins.

**Why:** Jumping to code causes wrong caching assumptions, missed ORM conventions, duplicated logic, and broken surrounding systems. Written artifacts anchor decisions through context compression.

**Key principle:** Implementation should be mechanical, not creative. All creative decisions happen during research and planning.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Artifact |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1. Research | `research.md` |
| 2. Plan | `plan.md` |
| 3. Implement | Working code |

## On Invocation

1. **Check for existing artifacts** — if `research.md` or `plan.md` exist at the project root, this is a resume. Read them and identify the last incomplete phase.
2. **If starting fresh** — ask: "What feature are we building? Describe it in 1–2 sentences."
3. Begin at Phase 1 unless the user directs otherwise.

Copy this checklist and check off items as you complete each phase:

Progress:
- [ ] Phase 1: Research
- [ ] Phase 2: Plan (annotation cycles: 0)
- [ ] Phase 3: Implement
```

## Phase 1: Research

Create `research.md` at the **project root** using [references/research-template.md](references/research-template.md).

**Deep-read directives** — for each area relevant to the feature:

1. **Trace execution paths** — follow the full request/response cycle, not just the entry point
2. **Map data flow** — how data moves between layers, what transforms happen
3. **Document conventions** — naming, error handling, validation patterns, test structure
4. **Identify reusable code** — existing functions, utilities, abstractions that solve similar problems
5. **Note constraints** — what could break, non-obvious coupling, performance-sensitive paths

Read deeply. Trace the full path from entry to exit. If a function calls 3 other functions, read all 3. Document intricacies, not surface patterns.

**Tools:** Glob, Grep, Read extensively. For indexed projects, use `qmd search`/`vector_search` before file reads. Use `Task(subagent_type="Explore")` for broad codebase exploration.

**Output:** Write structured findings to `research.md`. Every section must cite specific files and line numbers.

**Phase gate:** Research is complete when:

- All areas the feature touches are covered
- Open questions are listed in `research.md` and either resolved or explicitly surfaced to the user
- Existing patterns and conventions are documented with concrete file references

Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until the gate conditions are met. If open questions remain, surface them to the user before continuing.

## Phase 2: Plan

Create `plan.md` at the **project root** from research findings using [references/plan-template.md](references/plan-template.md). Use a custom markdown file — not Claude Code's built-in plan mode — for full editor control, inline annotation capability, and persistence as a project artifact.

**Plan structure:**

1. **Problem statement** — what exactly are we solving, and why now
2. **Approach** — high-level strategy with rationale
3. **File-by-file changes** — what changes in each file and why; include code snippets where helpful
4. **Trade-offs** — what we chose, what we rejected, and why
5. **Test strategy** — how to verify correctness
6. **Task list** — granular, ordered, checkable items

**Reference existing code as specification** — when the codebase already has similar patterns (e.g. another API endpoint, another component), reference that code explicitly as the model to follow. Do not design from scratch when a working example exists.

### Annotation Cycle

Present the plan for user review. The user may:

- Correct assumptions ("use drizzle:generate, not raw SQL")
- Reject sections ("remove this entirely")
- Add constraints ("retry logic is redundant here because...")
- Redirect architecture ("restructure the schema like this instead")

Revise `plan.md` based on feedback. **Write all user corrections into `plan.md`'s `## Annotations` section** so they persist through context compression. Repeat until the user approves. Track cycle count in the progress checklist.

**Do not implement during this phase.** If the user says "don't implement yet" — continue refining the plan.

## Phase 3: Implement

Execute the approved plan mechanically. Follow the task list in order. Do not stop until all tasks are completed.

**During implementation:**

- Mark tasks complete in `plan.md` as each is done
- Run type checks / linting continuously — do not accumulate errors
- No unnecessary comments, jsdocs, or type annotations beyond what the plan specifies
- No feature creep — if you notice something outside the plan, note it in `plan.md` under a `## Future` section, don't implement it
- Protect existing interfaces — do not change function signatures unless the plan explicitly calls for it; callers adapt, not the interface

**Feedback during implementation** — terse. Planning = paragraphs, implementation = single sentences. For visual issues, prefer screenshots over verbal descriptions.

**Scope discipline:**

- Cherry-pick proposals item-by-item — do not batch large changes
- If implementation reveals the plan was wrong → **stop, revert, and re-scope** (return to Phase 2)
- Do NOT incrementally patch a wrong direction — revert cleanly and re-plan

**When done:** Verify against the test strategy in the plan. Run tests, type checks, and any other validation the plan specifies. Mark Phase 3 complete in the progress checklist.

## Anti-patterns

- Jumping from prompt to code without written plan → missing conventions cause wrong assumptions that compound silently
- Chat-based steering instead of document-based annotation → chat messages get context-compressed; only `plan.md` Annotations survive long sessions
- Patching a bad approach incrementally instead of reverting → each patch adds complexity on top of a wrong foundation; technical debt compounds
- Using loose/any types to make things compile quickly → defers type errors to runtime; harder to trace and fix later
- Adding unnecessary comments or jsdocs to generated code → noise that clutters the codebase; well-named code is self-documenting
- Allowing scope creep during implementation phase → plan becomes inaccurate; hard to verify completion or revert cleanly
- Splitting research, planning, and implementation across separate sessions — single long sessions preserve context better
- Skipping open questions — unresolved ambiguities compound into plan errors

## Key Rules

- **Persistent artifacts** — `research.md` and `plan.md` anchor context through compression; if context is compacted, re-read both files before continuing
- **Plan before code** — all creative decisions happen in research/planning; implementation is execution only
- **Revert over patch** — if going wrong, revert and re-scope; incremental patches compound mistakes
- **Scope trimming** — actively cut scope; a smaller correct feature beats a larger broken one
- **Reference existing patterns** — use codebase code as specification, not abstract design
- **Emphatic depth** — surface-level research causes surface-level bugs; read deeply, trace fully
- **Annotation cycles are valuable** — 1–6 rounds of plan review catches more issues than rushing to code
