# Dev Loop Bootstrap

**Optional tools:** `fd` (faster file search, falls back to Glob), `ast-grep` (structural search, falls back to Grep).

Pre-gather shared project context in one pass so Phase 1 explorers don't redundantly re-read the same files.

## Steps

### 1. Map Project Structure

```bash
rtk tree --gitignore -L 3 --dirsfirst --prune
```

### 2. Read CLAUDE.md

Read `CLAUDE.md` in the current project root. Extract: conventions, patterns, test command, linting rules, architecture notes.

### 3. Find Entry Points

Locate key entry files — just names and one-line descriptions, not full content. Look for: `src/index.ts`, `app/`, `server.ts`, `start/routes.ts`, `pages/`, `app/page.tsx`, `routes/`.

```bash
fd -t f "(index|server|app|routes)\.(ts|tsx|js)" --max-depth 4 | head -15
```

### 4. Find Key Types in Task Area

Identify the primary area from `$ARGUMENTS` (Jira key or description).

Try `ast-grep` first, fall back to grep:

```bash
ast-grep -p 'interface $NAME $$$' . --json 2>/dev/null | head -30 \
  || rtk grep -rl "^export interface\|^export type" --include="*.ts" . 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

### 5. Detect Test Infrastructure

```bash
fd -t f "(vitest|jest)\.config\." --max-depth 3
```

Also check `package.json` for the test script.

### 6. Write Output

Create `.claude/dlc-build/` if it doesn't exist, then write `.claude/dlc-build/bootstrap-context.md`:

```markdown
# Bootstrap Context

**Task:** {task_description}
**Gathered:** {timestamp}

## Project Structure (Top 3 Levels)
{tree output}

## Conventions (from CLAUDE.md)
{key conventions — 5-10 bullet points, focus on patterns relevant to the task}

## Entry Points
{list of key files with one-line description}

## Key Types in Task Area
{list of relevant interfaces/types with file:line references}

## Test Infrastructure
{test config file, test command, test file pattern}
```

Keep each section concise — this is input to explorer agents, not a human report. Omit sections where nothing was found.
