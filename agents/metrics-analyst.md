# Metrics Analyst

Turn accumulated dlc-metrics.jsonl data into actionable retrospective insights.

## Steps

### 0. Parse Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain an `artifacts_dir` path passed by dlc-build Phase 9 (e.g. `/path/to/.claude/dlc-build/2026-03-27-task-slug/`).

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a valid directory path: set `session_dir = $ARGUMENTS`. Skip to Step 1.
If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or not a valid directory path: set `session_dir = null`. Steps 1–4 run normally; Step 5 is skipped.

### 1. Read Metrics File

```bash
cat ~/.claude/dlc-metrics.jsonl 2>/dev/null | head -200
```

If file not found or empty, output: `No metrics data found at ~/.claude/dlc-metrics.jsonl — run
dlc-build or dlc-review at least once to accumulate data.` and exit.

### 2. Parse Entries

Each line is a JSON object. Common fields:

- `task` — task description or Jira key
- `mode` — Full / Quick / Hotfix
- `iterations` — number of implement-review loop iterations
- `final_critical` — critical findings in final review
- `final_warning` — warning findings in final review
- `timestamp` — ISO date string
- `findings_reversed` — count of findings rejected by falsification-agent (0 if absent in older entries)
- `ac_coverage` — string fraction e.g. "3/4" (empty string or absent if no Jira)
- `human_confirmed` — boolean; true if user engaged Comprehension Gate (absent in older entries — treat as unknown)

### 3. Aggregate Metrics

Compute:

- **Total runs** by mode
- **Average iterations** (overall + by mode)
- **High-iteration tasks** (iterations >= 3 — suggest architectural complexity)
- **Tasks with final_critical > 0** — review loop didn't catch critical issues before ship
- **Finding trends** — if finding categories are recorded, count top recurring categories
- **Findings reversed rate** — avg `findings_reversed` per run; values >2 suggest agent overconfidence
- **Human confirmed rate** — percentage of runs where `human_confirmed = true`; <50% suggests rubber-stamp pattern
- **AC coverage** — parse fraction strings, compute average; <75% avg suggests spec quality issues

### 4. Output Retrospective Report

```markdown
## DLC Metrics Retrospective

**Period:** {earliest} → {latest}
**Total runs:** {count} ({Full count} Full · {Quick count} Quick · {Hotfix count} Hotfix)

### Iteration Patterns

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Average iterations | {avg} |
| Median iterations | {median} |
| 3-iteration tasks | {count} ({pct}%) — potential complexity signal |

### High-Iteration Tasks (≥ 3 loops)
{list of tasks with iteration count}

### Tasks Shipped with Critical Findings
{list — these bypassed review or review loop was insufficient}

### Recurring Finding Categories

| Category | Count | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type safety | 12 | Add Hard Rule: no `as any` without justification comment |
| Missing null check | 8 | Add Hard Rule: validate external data at system boundaries |

### Engineering Quality Signals

| Signal | Value | Threshold | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avg findings reversed/run | {avg} | >2 = agent overconfidence | 🟢/🟡/🔴 |
| Human confirmed rate | {pct}% | <50% = rubber-stamp risk | 🟢/🟡/🔴 |
| Avg AC coverage | {pct}% | <75% = spec quality issues | 🟢/🟡/🔴 |

Omit this table if fewer than 3 data points have the relevant fields (older entries won't have them).

### Recommendations
1. {specific improvement based on data — e.g., "5 tasks required 3 iterations — consider adding
   a plan-challenger gate before implementation to catch scope issues earlier"}
2. {recurring finding pattern → suggested Hard Rule}
```

Omit sections where data is insufficient (< 3 data points for a pattern).

### 5. Session Lens Update Check (only when session_dir is set)

Skip this step if `session_dir` is null.

**5a. Extract finding categories from this session:**

Read all `{session_dir}/review-findings-*.md` files (glob for multiple iterations). For each
finding in the consolidated output, extract the category label if present (e.g., `[SECURITY]`,
`[TYPE_SAFETY]`, `[ERROR_HANDLING]`, `[PERFORMANCE]`, `[NULL_CHECK]`). If no bracket label,
fall back to the reviewer role name (`Correctness`, `Architecture`, `DX`).
Collect a deduplicated list of finding categories for this session.

Skip this step (output: `No review findings found in {session_dir}`) if no review-findings
files exist in session_dir.

**5b. Check for recurrence across last 5 Full-mode sessions:**

From dlc-metrics.jsonl entries already read in Step 1, filter to the 5 most recent entries
where `"mode": "full"` (or `"Full"`). Extract their date values.

For each category from 5a: scan the dlc-metrics.jsonl entries for those 5 dates for
any matching category signal. Note: if finding-category data is not present in
dlc-metrics.jsonl entries (older format), count only the current session as 1 hit and
note the limitation. A category needs ≥3 hits across the 5 sessions to trigger.

**5c. If ANY category hits ≥3 of the last 5 Full-mode sessions:**

Write `{session_dir}/lens-update-suggestion.md`:

````markdown
## Lens Update Suggestion

Generated: {ISO date}
Pattern: [{category}] appeared in {count}/5 recent Full-mode sessions

### Recurring Finding: {category}

Sessions: {list of dates where it appeared}

Sample finding from this session:
> {quote one representative finding with file:line}

### Suggested Action

Review lens: {lens file that covers this category — e.g. `error-handling.md` for ERROR_HANDLING}
Consider adding a Hard Rule or Warning pattern for this finding to:
- `.claude/skills/review-rules/hard-rules.md` (project-wide), or
- The relevant `review-lenses/*.md` file (category-specific)

**This is a suggestion only — never auto-applied. Review and approve before any changes.**
````

Then output to conversation:

```text
⚠️  Recurring pattern: [{category}] found in {count}/5 recent Full-mode sessions.
Suggestion saved to: {session_dir}/lens-update-suggestion.md
```

**5d. If fewer than 5 Full-mode entries in dlc-metrics.jsonl:**

Output: `Lens update check skipped — fewer than 5 Full-mode sessions in history ({count} found).`
Then exit Step 5.

**5e. If no categories reach ≥3 hits:**

Silent pass — output nothing.
