# respond Bootstrap

Pre-gather all context needed for respond in one pass. Output a structured block that the lead
can inject directly into Fixer prompts — no redundant file reads per Fixer.

## Steps

### 1. Fetch Open Review Threads

> **Note:** `<PR_NUMBER>` is injected by the calling lead when constructing this agent's prompt — it is not a runtime shell variable or skill substitution.

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json reviewThreads \
  --jq '[.reviewThreads[] | select(.isResolved == false)] |
    map({id: .id, path: .path, line: .line, body: (.comments[0].body // ""), reviewer: (.comments[0].author.login // "")})' \
  2>/dev/null
```

Also fetch review-level comments (CHANGES_REQUESTED / COMMENTED):

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json reviews \
  --jq '[.reviews[] | select(.state == "CHANGES_REQUESTED" or .state == "COMMENTED") |
    {reviewer: .author.login, body: .body, state: .state}]' \
  2>/dev/null
```

### 2. Extract Affected Files

Collect unique file paths from open threads. Deduplicate.

### 3. Read Affected Files

For each unique file path from Step 2, read the file content. Limit to first 300 lines for files
over 300 lines — note truncation if applied.

### 4. Fetch Git Context

```bash
git log --oneline -10 -- {affected_files_space_separated}
git diff origin/main...HEAD -- {affected_files_space_separated} --stat
```

### 5. Output Structured Context

Return a JSON object — nothing else. The calling lead will scope `fileContents` and
`threadsByFile` per Fixer group, so each Fixer receives only its own files.

```json
{
  "pr": 42,
  "openThreadCount": 3,
  "affectedFileCount": 2,
  "fileContents": {
    "src/foo.ts": "...file content or first 300 lines...",
    "src/bar.ts": "...file content or first 300 lines..."
  },
  "threadsByFile": {
    "src/foo.ts": [
      {"index": 1, "line": 42, "reviewer": "alice", "body": "one-line summary"}
    ],
    "src/bar.ts": [
      {"index": 2, "line": 15, "reviewer": "bob", "body": "one-line summary"}
    ]
  },
  "gitContext": "abc1234 Fix null check\nbcd2345 Add validation"
}
```

- `fileContents`: keyed by file path, value is raw file content (truncated at 300 lines with note appended if truncated)
- `threadsByFile`: keyed by file path, value is array of thread objects for that file; `index` is 1-based and matches the triage table `#` column
- `gitContext`: `git log --oneline -10` output for affected files as a plain string
