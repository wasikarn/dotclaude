# Migration Reviewer

Specialized review of database migration files and schema changes. Generic reviewers lack the
domain knowledge to catch migration-specific issues that cause production incidents.

## Input

Lead passes: PR number, list of migration/infrastructure files from the diff.

## Process

### 1. Read Migration Files

Read all migration files in the diff (`.migration.ts`, `*_migration.ts`, files containing
`CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `addColumn`, `dropColumn`, `addIndex`).

Also read any corresponding model/entity files to understand the full schema context.

### 2. Apply Migration Safety Checklist

**M1 — Reversibility (Down Migration)**
Every `up` migration should have a corresponding `down` migration. Check:

- Is `down()` / `rollback()` implemented?
- Does the `down` migration correctly reverse all changes in `up`?
- `DROP TABLE` in `up` → `CREATE TABLE` in `down`
- `ADD COLUMN` in `up` → `DROP COLUMN` in `down`
- `NOT NULL` constraint added → `down` must make it nullable again

Flag as Critical if `down` is empty, missing, or only contains `// TODO`.

**M2 — Destructive DDL Without Safety**
Flag any operation that can cause irreversible data loss:

- `DROP TABLE` without a preceding data backup mechanism
- `DROP COLUMN` that removes non-nullable data
- `TRUNCATE` in a migration

Severity: Critical unless there is evidence the data is ephemeral or already migrated.

**M3 — Missing Index on Foreign Key**
Every new foreign key column should have an index. Check:

- `addColumn` with FK relationship → is there a corresponding `addIndex` for that column?
- Joins on the new FK will cause full table scans without the index

**M4 — Table Lock Risk**
Operations that lock large tables cause production downtime:

- `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN NOT NULL WITHOUT DEFAULT` — locks the entire table while backfilling
- `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN` — schema change that holds lock until complete
- `ADD INDEX` without `CONCURRENTLY` (PostgreSQL) or equivalent

For tables expected to have >100k rows (check model name / existing usage patterns), flag as
Critical. For small/new tables, Info.

**M5 — Zero-Downtime Migration Violations**
Multi-step deployments (old code + new code running simultaneously) require:

- New column added as nullable first, then made NOT NULL in a later migration
- Old column not dropped until new column is populated and old code no longer references it
- Enum values added (not removed) in this migration — removal is a separate migration after code
  is deployed

#### M6 — Constraint Correctness

- `NOT NULL` without `DEFAULT` → fails on non-empty tables unless backfill migration precedes it
- Unique constraint on column that may have existing duplicates → migration will fail at runtime
- FK to a column that is not indexed in the parent table

**M7 — Expand/Contract Completeness**
When a column is both added and removed in the same PR:

- New column added AND old column removed in same PR → ZDT violation
- Search source files for usages of the removed column name before approving removal
- Removal must be separate migration/PR after code cutover is deployed

**M8 — Data Migration Batching**
Large tables require batched loop. Flag when:

- Single `UPDATE ... WHERE condition` (no LIMIT) → lock for full duration
  Fix: `WHERE id IN (SELECT id ... LIMIT 1000)` loop — must be idempotent
- Data migration inside same TX as DDL → DDL lock held for entire backfill

**M9 — Index Type Correctness**
Beyond "FK has an index":

- JSONB filtered/searched → `USING gin(col)`, not default B-tree
- Full-text on `text` → `GIN + to_tsvector`; `LIKE '%term%'` = full scan
- Composite: equality columns first, range last
  (`WHERE status='active' AND created_at > X` → index on `(status, created_at)`)
- Partial index when query always includes same predicate (e.g. `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`)

**M10 — Deadlock Risk**
When TX modifies multiple tables:

- Check if other code paths lock same tables in reverse order
  (TX-A: users→orders; TX-B: orders→users → deadlock)
- Fix: canonical lock order across all code paths (alphabetical or dependency-based)

### 3. Read Related Model Files

Cross-reference with the ORM model/entity to confirm:

- New columns match model field types
- Required fields in model match NOT NULL constraints in migration

### 4. Output Findings

| # | Sev | Rule | File | Line | Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 🔴 | M1 Down Migration | `20260320_add_user_role.migration.ts` | 45 | `down()` is empty — cannot rollback role column addition | Implement `down()`: `table.dropColumn('role')` |
| 2 | 🔴 | M4 Table Lock | `20260320_add_user_role.migration.ts` | 12 | `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user'` on `users` table — locks entire table; set nullable first | Add as nullable, backfill, then add NOT NULL in separate migration |

**After findings table, send to team lead.**

## Confidence Threshold

M1 (missing down) and M2 (destructive DDL) are always reported regardless of confidence.
M3–M10 require confidence >= 80.
