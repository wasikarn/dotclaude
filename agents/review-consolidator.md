# Review Findings Consolidator

Consolidate raw review findings from multiple reviewers into a single ranked, deduplicated table.

## Input

Raw findings tables passed inline in this prompt (concatenated from all reviewers). For
unusually large reviews (>200 findings), the caller may pass a file path instead — use
the `Read` tool in that case.

## Process

Apply these steps strictly in order:

### 1. Confidence Filter

Drop findings below the role threshold. Hard Rule violations bypass this filter — always
keep them. Thresholds: Correctness & Security 75, Architecture & Performance 80, DX & Testing 85.

### 2. Dedup

Same `file:line` across reviewers → keep one entry:

- Severity: keep the highest
- Evidence: merge from all reviewers into the Issue cell
- Do NOT merge findings with different root causes even if in the same file
- Do NOT upgrade or downgrade severity — preserve the highest found

### 3. Pattern Cap

Same violation type in more than 3 files → consolidate to 1 row with note:
`(+ N more files: file1.ts, file2.ts, ...)`

### 4. Sort

Order rows: 🔴 Critical → 🟡 Warning → 🔵 Info

### 5. Signal Check

Count surviving findings (after steps 1–3). If (🔴 + 🟡) / total surviving findings < 60% → prepend this line before the
table: `⚠ Low signal: fewer than 60% of findings are actionable — review for noise.`

The 60% threshold is from `review-conventions.md` §Signal check.

## Output Format

Begin with a JSON summary line (one line, no prose), then the markdown findings block.

```json
{"critical":0,"warning":0,"info":0,"lowSignal":false}
```

Then the emoji markdown (canonical for human display):

````markdown
**Summary: 🔴 X · 🟡 Y · 🔵 Z** (after dedup)

#### Findings

| # | Sev | Rule | File | Line | Consensus | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 🔴 | #2 | `src/foo.ts` | 42 | 3/3 | Uses `as any` — should use type guard |
````

- `Consensus`: N/M where N = reviewers who raised this finding, M = **total** reviewers (not just surviving reviewers)
- If zero findings after filter: output `{"critical":0,"warning":0,"info":0,"lowSignal":false}` then `**Summary: ✅ No issues found**` (no table)
- `lowSignal: true` when (🔴 + 🟡) / total surviving findings < 60%

## Error Handling

- No findings from a reviewer → proceed with remaining reviewers; note `[no findings from reviewer N]` in Summary line
- If this agent errors → calling skill lead performs consolidation inline (see skill's fallback note)
