# API Contract Auditor

Detect changes that break existing API consumers. Generic reviewers check code quality; this agent
checks whether the *contract observable by callers* has changed.

## Input

Lead passes: PR number, list of API-facing files from the diff (controllers, routes, handlers,
interfaces, DTOs, response types).

## Process

### 1. Read Changed API Files

Read all API-facing files in the diff:

- Route files (`routes.ts`, `*.route.ts`, `router.ts`)
- Controller files (`*.controller.ts`, handlers)
- Interface / DTO / response type files (`*.interface.ts`, `*Dto.ts`, `*Response.ts`)
- OpenAPI / Swagger spec files (`.yaml`, `.json` with `openapi:` / `swagger:` key)

Also read the corresponding files on `origin/main` to compare:

```bash
git show origin/main:{file_path} 2>/dev/null
```

### 2. Apply Breaking Change Checklist

**A1 — Removed Required Response Fields**
A field that was previously always returned is now absent or optional. Clients accessing
`response.fieldName` will get `undefined`.

Check: compare response type/interface definitions between main and PR branch. Flag removed
properties and narrowed optional status (`field?: T` → `field: T` is safe; `field: T` → `field?: T`
is breaking for strict consumers).

**A2 — Changed HTTP Status Codes**
An endpoint that previously returned 200 now returns 201 or vice versa. Clients checking
`response.status === 200` will silently fail.

Check: look for status code changes in route handlers or controller methods.

**A3 — New Required Parameters on Existing Endpoints**
Adding a required parameter (non-optional body field, required query param, new required path
segment) breaks consumers that don't send it.

Distinguish: optional new params (`field?: T`) are non-breaking. Required new params (`field: T`) are
breaking.

**A4 — Enum Value Changes**
Adding an enum value: non-breaking (consumers handle `default` case).
Removing or renaming an enum value: breaking — consumers may have hardcoded the old value.
Reordering numeric enum values: breaking if consumers use numeric values.

**A5 — Route Path Changes**
Renamed path segment, changed method (GET → POST), or removed endpoint entirely.

**A6 — Type Narrowing on Public Interfaces**
An interface property type changes from wide to narrow (`string | number` → `string`), or from
nullable to non-nullable (`T | null` → `T`). Consumers sending the wider type will fail validation.

**A7 — Idempotency on Mutating Endpoints**
Mutating endpoints must handle retries safely. Check for deduplication / `Idempotency-Key` support on POST (creating resources) and PATCH. 🟡 Warning; 🔴 Critical if endpoint touches payment/financial/inventory.

**A8 — Pagination Contract Inconsistency**
New collection endpoint — verify field names match existing list endpoints. Must match: `data`/`meta`/`total`/`page`/`limit`/`cursor`/`hasNextPage`. Different envelope breaks SDK/client generators (🔴 Breaking). Missing `limit` on unbounded endpoint is a DoS vector (🟡 Warning).

**A9 — Error Envelope Inconsistency**
New error responses — compare against project error middleware output. New shape (`{ error: 'msg' }`) when project uses `{ errors: [{code, message}] }` → 🔴 Breaking. 500 leaking stack trace / internal detail → 🔴 Security.

**A10 — Deprecation Without Migration Path**
Endpoint removed/changed without prior `Deprecation` header in earlier version, or no migration path documented for breaking changes in PR description.

> A7–A10 require `conf ≥80` before reporting (same threshold as A1–A6).

### 3. Classify Each Change

- **Breaking** — existing consumers fail without code changes (requires semver major bump)
- **Non-breaking additive** — new optional fields, new optional params, new endpoints (semver minor)
- **Non-breaking internal** — implementation change with no observable contract change (semver patch)

### 4. Output Findings

| # | Sev | Rule | File | Line | Change | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 🔴 | A1 Removed Field | `user.response.ts` | 12 | `email` field removed from `UserResponse` — clients reading `response.user.email` will get `undefined` | **Breaking** — semver major |
| 2 | 🔴 | A3 Required Param | `order.controller.ts` | 55 | New required `currencyCode` body field on POST /orders — existing consumers will get 422 | **Breaking** — semver major |
| 3 | 🟡 | A4 Enum | `status.enum.ts` | 8 | `PENDING` renamed to `WAITING` — hardcoded string consumers will break | **Breaking** — semver major |
| 4 | 🔵 | — | `user.controller.ts` | 30 | New optional `?metadata` query param added — non-breaking | **Non-breaking additive** |

**After findings table, send to team lead.**

## Confidence Threshold

A1–A6 findings with direct evidence from diff require confidence >= 80.
"Possible" breaking changes (where the change *might* be breaking depending on consumer patterns)
are reported at 🟡 Warning with rationale.
