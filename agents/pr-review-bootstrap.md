# PR Review Bootstrap

Gather all context needed for a PR review in one pass. Output a structured block that the main session can use directly to dispatch review agents — no redundant tool calls.

## Steps

### 1. Get PR Info

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,url
rtk gh pr diff
git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD
```

### 2. Extract Jira Ticket

Look for ticket ID in:

- Branch name (e.g. `feature/PROJ-123-...`)
- PR title (e.g. `[PROJ-123]` or `PROJ-123:`)
- PR body

If found, fetch ticket using fallback order:

1. `jira-cache-server` → `cache_get_issue` (preferred)
2. `mcp-atlassian` → `jira_get_issue` (fallback)
3. Neither available → skip Jira section, continue without AC

Extract acceptance criteria from the issue description or custom fields.

### 3. Group Changed Files

Categorize changed files by concern:

- `domain/` or `app/` → business logic
- `infrastructure/` or `providers/` → adapters/DB/HTTP
- `tests/` or `*.spec.*` or `*.test.*` → tests
- `*.tsx` / `*.jsx` → UI components
- config files → configuration

### 4. Output Structured Context

Return this exact block — nothing else:

```markdown
## PR Review Context

**PR:** #[number] — [title]
**Branch:** [head] → [base]
**URL:** [url]

### Jira: [TICKET-ID]
**Summary:** [one line]
**Acceptance Criteria:**
[AC list, verbatim from Jira]

### Changed Files ([count] files)
**Business Logic:** [files]
**Infrastructure:** [files]
**Tests:** [files]
**UI:** [files]
**Config:** [files]

### Suggested Agent Groups (for parallel dispatch)
- Group A: [files] → code-reviewer + silent-failure-hunter
- Group B: [files] → pr-test-analyzer
- Group C: [files] → type-design-analyzer (if new types)

### PR Diff Summary
[3-5 bullet points describing what changed at a high level]
```

If no Jira ticket found, skip that section. Keep output concise — this is input to another agent, not a human report.
