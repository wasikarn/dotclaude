# Research Validator

Structural gate check on research.md before Phase 1 → Phase 2 transition. Validates that explorers
produced concrete evidence, not just section headers.

## Steps

### 1. Locate research.md

Read the file path passed via `$ARGUMENTS` (the lead passes `{artifacts_dir}/research.md` when dispatching). If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, fallback: compute path via `bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../scripts/artifact-dir.sh" build 2>/dev/null`, then read the most recent `*/research.md` under that base dir. If not found, output `FAIL: research.md not found` and exit.

### 2. Detect Research Tier

Check the research.md header for tier marker:

- **Lite** (Quick mode): expects `## Context`, `## WHAT`, `## WHY`, `## Token Count` sections
- **Deep** (Full mode): expects `## Context`, `## ADDED`, `## MODIFIED`, `## REMOVED`, `## Token Count`, `## GO/NO-GO Verdict` sections

If no tier marker, infer from structure: Lite if only WHAT/WHY found, Deep if ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED found.

### 3. Check Required Sections (tier-aware)

**Lite tier:** Verify these sections exist:

- `## Context` — 2-3 sentences about what exists and what changes
- `## WHAT` — behaviors that must be true after the task
- `## WHY` — reason for the change
- `## Token Count` — present

**Deep tier:** Verify these sections exist:

- `## Context` — existing architecture patterns
- `## ADDED` — new files/patterns/dependencies
- `## MODIFIED` — existing files that will change (with before/after)
- `## REMOVED` — anything deprecated or deleted
- `## Token Count` — present with value
- `## GO/NO-GO Verdict` — present

### 4. Token Count Check (Deep tier only)

If `## Token Count:` line is present, extract the number:

- `< 900`: flag as potentially incomplete — list which sections are thin
- `900–1600`: ✅ acceptable
- `> 1600`: flag as context rot risk — note which sections are verbose

### 5. Count file:line Evidence

Count occurrences of `file:line` patterns in research.md:

Pattern: any path ending in `.<ext>` followed by `:` and a line number (e.g., `src/user.ts:42`,
`app/services/auth.service.ts:115`).

Minimum required: **5 file:line references** for Deep tier, **2 file:line references** for Lite tier.

### 6. Check for Empty Sections

Flag any section heading that is immediately followed by another heading or end-of-file with no
content between them (empty section body).

Also flag if fewer than 3 files are listed in the findings for non-trivial tasks — this is the signal to spawn a second focused explorer.

### 7. Output Verdict

Begin with a JSON summary line (one line, no prose), then the markdown block.

```json
{"result":"PASS","tier":"Deep","fileLineCount":8,"tokenCount":1200,"tokenStatus":"ok","issues":[]}
```

For FAIL, include issues in the array:

```json
{"result":"FAIL","tier":"Deep","fileLineCount":2,"tokenCount":400,"tokenStatus":"thin","issues":["Missing section: ADDED","Insufficient evidence: only 2 file:line references found"]}
```

Then the markdown block:

```markdown
## Research Validation

**Tier:** Lite | Deep
**Result:** PASS | FAIL
**File:line references found:** {count} (minimum: 5 Deep / 2 Lite)
**Token count:** {N} tokens ({status: OK / thin / over-budget})

### Issues
- Missing section: "ADDED" — required for Deep tier
- Empty section: "## MODIFIED" has no content
- Insufficient evidence: only 2 file:line references found
- Thin coverage: fewer than 3 files listed — consider spawning a second focused explorer

### Passing Checks
- ✅ Context section present with content
- ✅ ADDED section present
- ✅ Token count in acceptable range (1,100 tokens)
```

On PASS, output JSON then summary line and passing checks only (no issues table).
On FAIL, lead should re-dispatch the relevant explorer with a targeted prompt before proceeding to
Phase 2.
