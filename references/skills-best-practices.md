# Skills Best Practices

Researched 2026-03-11 from official Claude Code docs (`code.claude.com/docs/en/skills`).

## Supported Frontmatter Fields

All fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended.

| Field | Description | Max |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Display name / slash command trigger. Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens. | 64 chars |
| `description` | What it does + when to use it. Claude uses this for auto-invocation. | 1024 chars |
| `argument-hint` | Hint shown during `/` autocomplete (e.g. `[issue-number]`). | — |
| `disable-model-invocation` | `true` = only user can invoke. Removes description from context. | — |
| `user-invocable` | `false` = hides from `/` menu. Claude can still auto-invoke. | — |
| `allowed-tools` | Tools auto-approved when skill is active (e.g. `Read, Grep, Bash(gh *)`). | — |
| `model` | Model override when skill is active (e.g. `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`). | — |
| `effort` | Override effort level for this skill: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`. `max` is Opus 4.6 only. | — |
| `context` | `fork` = run in isolated subagent context. | — |
| `agent` | Subagent type when `context: fork` (e.g. `Explore`, `Plan`, custom agent). | — |
| `hooks` | Lifecycle hooks scoped to this skill. See hooks docs for format. | — |
| `compatibility` | Prerequisites (CLIs, env, repo context). From agentskills.io spec. | 500 chars |
| `license` | License identifier. From agentskills.io spec. | — |
| `metadata` | Arbitrary metadata object. From agentskills.io spec. | — |

## disable-model-invocation vs user-invocable

| Setting | In context? | `/` menu | Auto-invoke |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| (default) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `user-invocable: false` | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

## Description Rules

1. Max **1024 chars** — use the full budget for auto-invoked skills
2. Cover **what** it does AND **when** to use it
3. **Third person** — injected into system prompt
4. Include **specific trigger keywords** users would naturally say
5. No XML tags

✅ **Good** — specific, trigger-complete, covers what + when + keywords:

```yaml
description: "Summarize PR changes. Use when user asks for PR summary, code review overview, or wants to understand what changed in a PR. Triggers: review PR, summarize PR, what changed, PR overview."
```

❌ **Bad** — too short, no trigger keywords, no when-to-use context:

```yaml
description: "Summarizes things."
```

❌ **Bad** — exceeds 1024 chars, no auto-invocation budget for other skills; contains XML tags:

```yaml
description: "<skill>This is a very detailed and comprehensive skill that does many things including but not limited to reviewing code, summarizing PRs, analyzing diffs, providing feedback on code quality, checking for security issues, looking at performance, verifying types, checking tests, examining architecture, reviewing naming conventions, and much more.</skill>"
```

## Description Context Budget

- **2% of context window** (floor: 16,000 chars) at startup
- If many skills are installed and exceed budget, some are excluded — run `/context` to check
- Override: `SLASH_COMMAND_TOOL_CHAR_BUDGET` env var

## String Substitutions

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `$ARGUMENTS` | All arguments passed when invoking. Appended as `ARGUMENTS: <value>` if not present in content. |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]` / `$N` | Access specific argument by 0-based index (e.g. `$0` = first arg). |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | Current session ID. |
| `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` | Directory containing the skill's SKILL.md. Use for referencing bundled scripts/files. |
| `` !`cmd` `` | Shell injection — command runs before content is sent to Claude, output replaces placeholder. |

## File Structure

```text
skills/<name>/
  SKILL.md         # Entry point. Keep under ~500 lines / 5k tokens.
  CLAUDE.md        # Local maintenance context (tracked in git)
  references/      # Supporting docs — loaded on demand, no size limit
  scripts/         # Pre-written scripts > asking Claude to generate inline
```

**Progressive disclosure:**

| Level | Content | When loaded |
| ------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 1 — Metadata | `name` + `description` | Always, at startup |
| 2 — Instructions | SKILL.md body | On invoke |
| 3 — Resources | `references/` files | When accessed |

## Content Principles

- **Single default** over multiple options: "use pdfplumber; for OCR use pdf2image instead"
- **High freedom** (guidelines) for flexible tasks; **low freedom** (exact commands) for fragile ops
- **File references one level deep** — avoid nested chains; Claude may `head -100` partial reads
- **Reference files explicitly** — state what each file contains and when to load it
- **Consistent terminology** — pick one term and never vary it
- **Pre-written scripts** beat asking Claude to generate code inline
- **No time-sensitive info** — don't write "before August 2025 use X"
- **Include a feedback loop** — run validator → fix → repeat pattern in workflows

### Content Principle Examples

**Single default:**

✅ **Good** — one clear default with an explicit escape hatch:

```markdown
Parse PDF using pdfplumber. For scanned PDFs with no text layer, use pdf2image + pytesseract instead.
```

❌ **Bad** — forces Claude to choose without guidance:

```markdown
Parse PDF using pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, or pypdf depending on the use case.
```

**Pre-written scripts vs inline generation:**

✅ **Good** — references a bundled script:

```markdown
Run the scan:
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/scan-env.sh [project-root]
Parse JSON output. Key fields: schema_vars, gaps.in_code_not_schema
```

❌ **Bad** — asks Claude to write the script on the fly (inconsistent, consumes tokens):

```markdown
Write a bash script to scan all .ts files for process.env references and compare against the schema file.
```

**Feedback loop:**

✅ **Good** — explicit fix → validate → repeat cycle:

```markdown
After applying fixes, run: npm test
If tests fail: read error, adjust, re-run. Repeat up to 3 times.
If still failing after 3 attempts: revert and report what failed.
```

❌ **Bad** — no validation step, no retry/revert logic:

```markdown
Apply the fixes to the schema file and .env.example.
```

## Skill Discovery / Installation

Precedence (highest wins): Enterprise → Personal `~/.claude/skills/` → Project `.claude/skills/` → Plugin

```bash
bash scripts/link-skill.sh <name>   # install one
bash scripts/link-skill.sh          # install all
bash scripts/link-skill.sh --list   # check symlink status
```
