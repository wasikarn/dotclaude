## Skills

### DLC Workflow Skills

The four DLC skills form a complete development loop. Each runs a team of specialized agents that work in parallel, debate findings, and produce structured output.

└──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

---

#### `dlc-build` — Full Development Loop

The primary workflow for any coding task. Runs Research → Plan → Implement → Review → Ship with an iterative fix-review loop.

**When to use:** New features, bug fixes, refactors, Jira tickets, CI failures, production hotfixes.

```bash
/claude-code-skills:dlc-build "add rate limiting to the API"
/claude-code-skills:dlc-build PROJ-1234           # auto-fetches Jira AC
/claude-code-skills:dlc-build PROJ-1234 --quick   # skip research for small fixes
/claude-code-skills:dlc-build PROJ-1234 --hotfix  # urgent production incident
```

| Mode | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| _(default)_ | Full loop — research, plan, implement, review |
| `--quick` | Small fix with clear scope — skip research phase |
| `--hotfix` | Branches from `main`, creates backport PR to `develop` |

---

#### `dlc-review` — Adversarial PR Review

Three agents independently review a PR, then debate their findings in rounds to eliminate false positives. Final output is a single ranked table with evidence-backed findings.

**When to use:** Reviewing any pull request — quick standards check, architecture review, or thorough multi-perspective analysis.

```bash
/claude-code-skills:dlc-review 42                  # PR number
/claude-code-skills:dlc-review 42 PROJ-1234        # with Jira AC verification
/claude-code-skills:dlc-review 42 Author           # apply fixes directly to the branch
/claude-code-skills:dlc-review 42 Reviewer         # post findings as GitHub review comments
```

| Mode | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| `Author` | You own the PR and want fixes applied automatically |
| `Reviewer` | You are reviewing someone else's PR and want GitHub comments posted |

---

#### `dlc-respond` — Address PR Review Comments

Fetches all open GitHub review threads on a PR, groups them by file, fixes each issue in parallel, commits changes, and posts replies to close each thread.

**When to use:** After receiving PR review feedback and needing to address all comments systematically.

```bash
/claude-code-skills:dlc-respond 42
/claude-code-skills:dlc-respond 42 PROJ-1234   # with Jira AC context for prioritization
```

---

#### `dlc-debug` — Parallel Root Cause Analysis

Two agents run in parallel: an Investigator traces the root cause through logs, stack traces, and code, while a DX Analyst audits observability, error handling, and test coverage in the affected area. A Fixer agent then applies the fix.

**When to use:** Complex bugs, production incidents, or when you want to harden the affected area alongside the fix.

```bash
/claude-code-skills:dlc-debug "NullPointerException in UserService"
/claude-code-skills:dlc-debug PROJ-5678          # from a Jira bug ticket
/claude-code-skills:dlc-debug PROJ-5678 --quick  # fix only, skip DX analysis
```

---

### Utility Skills

#### `merge-pr` — Git-flow Merge & Deploy

Automates the full merge and release process following git-flow conventions: version bumps, CHANGELOG updates, tags, backport PRs, and post-merge verification.

```bash
/claude-code-skills:merge-pr 42           # feature/bugfix → develop
/claude-code-skills:merge-pr --hotfix     # hotfix → main + backport to develop
/claude-code-skills:merge-pr --release    # release → main + tag + backport
```

**Requires:** `gh` CLI (authenticated), clean working tree, GitHub remote.

---

#### `optimize-context` — Audit CLAUDE.md

Scores a CLAUDE.md file across quality dimensions, identifies bloat and gaps, and rewrites sections to be more useful for Claude. Safe to run — use `--dry-run` to preview changes.

```bash
/claude-code-skills:optimize-context
/claude-code-skills:optimize-context --dry-run    # preview without editing
/claude-code-skills:optimize-context --coverage   # include coverage analysis
```

---

#### `env-heal` — Fix Environment Variables

Scans the codebase for all env var references, cross-references against the validation schema and `.env.example`, classifies gaps, auto-fixes discrepancies, and runs tests to verify.

```bash
/claude-code-skills:env-heal              # full scan and fix
/claude-code-skills:env-heal --quick      # schema vs .env.example only
/claude-code-skills:env-heal --dry-run    # preview changes without applying
```

**Supports:** AdonisJS (`Env.schema`), dotenv (`.env.example`), and any Node.js project.

---

#### `systems-thinking` — Causal Loop Analysis

Helps think through complex architecture decisions by mapping causal loops, identifying feedback cycles, and surfacing second-order effects before committing to a direction.

```bash
/claude-code-skills:systems-thinking "should we move to microservices?"
/claude-code-skills:systems-thinking "what happens if we remove the cache layer?"
```

---

## Agents

Specialized subagents that the DLC skills and other workflows spawn automatically. You can also invoke them directly.

| Agent | Model | Invoked by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `commit-finalizer` | Haiku | Manually | Fast git commit — formats conventional commit messages |
| `dev-loop-bootstrap` | Haiku | `dlc-build` Phase 1 | Pre-gathers project structure and type definitions |
| `dlc-debug-bootstrap` | Haiku | `dlc-debug` Phase 0 | Pre-gathers stack trace context and affected files |
| `pr-review-bootstrap` | Sonnet | `dlc-review` Phase 0 | Fetches PR diff, Jira AC, and groups changed files |
| `review-consolidator` | Haiku | `dlc-review` Phase 4 | Deduplicates and ranks findings from multiple reviewers |
| `skill-validator` | Sonnet | Manually | Validates SKILL.md frontmatter and description quality |
| `tathep-reviewer` | Sonnet | Manually | Code reviewer with persistent memory (tathep projects) |

---

## Hooks

These hooks are distributed automatically with the plugin and activate on install. No manual configuration required.

| Hook | Event | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check-deps.sh` | `SessionStart` | Warns in context if `jq`, `gh`, or `rtk` are missing |
| `session-start-context.sh` | `SessionStart` | Injects current git branch and uncommitted file count |
| `skill-routing.sh` | `UserPromptSubmit` | Detects workflow keywords and suggests the right skill before responding |
| `protect-files.sh` | `PreToolUse[Edit\|Write]` | Blocks Claude from editing `.claude/settings.json` directly |
| _(inline)_ | `PostToolUse[Edit\|Write]` | Auto-lints `.md` files with `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` |
| `shellcheck-written-scripts.sh` | `PostToolUse[Write]` | Auto-validates `.sh` files Claude writes |
| `task-gate.sh` | `TaskCompleted` | Requires `file:line` evidence before agent tasks are marked complete |
| `idle-nudge.sh` | `TeammateIdle` | Nudges idle Agent Teams teammates back on task |

### Skill Routing Keywords

`skill-routing.sh` detects these patterns and injects a skill hint before Claude responds:

| Pattern | Suggested skill |
| --- | --- |
| `bug`, `broken`, `failing`, `crash`, `test fail` | `dlc-debug` |
| `ready to merge`, `feature complete`, `ready for PR` | `dlc-review` → ship workflow |
| `review PR`, `review pull request`, `review code` | `dlc-review` |
| `implement`, `add feature`, `build component`, `create page` | `dlc-build` |

---

## Output Styles

Activate an output style to change how Claude communicates throughout a session.

| Style | How to activate | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `thai-tech-lead` | `/output-style thai-tech-lead` | Thai language responses, English for code and technical terms. Concise, architecture-focused. |
| `coding-mentor` | `/output-style coding-mentor` | Explains architectural decisions and trade-offs inline while writing code. Good for onboarding. |

---

## Jira Integration

DLC skills auto-fetch Jira context when you pass a ticket key (e.g. `PROJ-123`). Configure one MCP server to enable:

| MCP Server | Notes | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mcp-atlassian` | Direct Jira API | [sooperset/mcp-atlassian](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian) |
| `jira-cache-server` | Cached, faster | [wasikarn/jira-cache-server](https://github.com/wasikarn/jira-cache-server) |

> If neither is configured, skills skip Jira context silently and continue normally. Jira is never a blocker.

---

## Troubleshooting

### DLC skills do nothing / no agents spawn

Agent Teams must be enabled:

```bash
claude config set env.CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS 1
```

Restart Claude Code after setting.

### Skills not triggering automatically

`skill-routing.sh` detects keywords and suggests skills. If it's not triggering, verify the plugin is installed:

```bash
claude plugin list
# Expected: claude-code-skills appears
```

If missing, reinstall: `claude plugin install wasikarn/claude-code-skills`

### Warning about missing tools at session start

Install the flagged tools:

```bash
brew install jq gh rtk
gh auth login
```

Then restart Claude Code to dismiss the warning.

### Jira context not loading

Jira is optional. If you want it, configure `mcp-atlassian` or `jira-cache-server`. See [Jira Integration](#jira-integration).

### Plugin skills show as `claude-code-skills:skill-name`

This is correct. Skills installed via plugin are namespaced automatically to avoid conflicts.
