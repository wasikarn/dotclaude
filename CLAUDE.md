# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

**Plugin name:** `devflow` · **Repo:** `wasikarn/devflow`

A Claude Code plugin — skills, agents, hooks, output styles, and scripts for structured development and PR review workflows. Each skill is a self-contained prompt workflow installed via `claude plugin install devflow`.

## Agents

Custom subagents live at `agents/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter. Distributed automatically via plugin.

Key fields: `description` (include "proactively" to auto-trigger), `memory` (`user`/`project`/`local` for cross-session persistence), `skills` (preload into agent context). All fields: `name`, `tools`/`disallowedTools`, `model`, `hooks`, `permissionMode`, `maxTurns`, `background`, `isolation`.

> **Plugin limitation:** `hooks`, `mcpServers`, and `permissionMode` are silently ignored when agents are loaded from a plugin. To use these fields, copy the agent to `.claude/agents/` instead.

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `commit-finalizer` | haiku | Fast git commit with conventional commits format |
| `review-consolidator` | haiku | Dedup/sort multi-reviewer findings into single ranked table |
| `falsification-agent` | sonnet | Challenges review findings before consolidation |
| `plan-challenger` | sonnet | Challenges build Phase 3 plan for YAGNI/scope/ordering issues |
| `test-quality-reviewer` | sonnet | Test quality reviewer (T1–T9): behavior, mock fidelity, edge cases |
| `silent-failure-hunter` | sonnet | Hunts for silent failures — swallowed exceptions, empty catch blocks |
| `code-reviewer` | sonnet | General-purpose code reviewer with cross-session persistent memory |
| `type-design-analyzer` | sonnet | TypeScript type design quality — 4 dimensions rated 1-10 |

> **Note:** Table shows key agents only. Full agent list: see [agents/](agents/) — 27 agents total.

## Hooks

Hooks live at `hooks/`. All hooks are registered in `hooks/hooks.json` and distributed automatically when the plugin is installed — no manual configuration required.

| Event | Matcher | Script |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionStart` | `startup` | `check-deps.sh`, `session-start-context.sh` |
| `PreToolUse` | `Edit\|Write` | `protect-files.sh` |
| `PreToolUse` | `Bash` | `safe-command-approver.sh` |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | `Bash` | `bash-failure-hint.sh` |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | `Edit\|Write` | `edit-write-failure-hint.sh` |
| `TaskCompleted` | `review-debate` | `task-gate.sh` |
| `TaskCompleted` | `devflow` | `task-gate.sh` |
| `TaskCompleted` | `respond` | `task-gate.sh` |
| `SubagentStart` | reviewer agents | `subagent-start-context.sh` |
| `PreCompact` | — | `pre-compact-save.sh` |
| `PostCompact` | — | `post-compact-context.sh` |
| `TeammateIdle` | `review-pr` | `idle-nudge.sh` |
| `TeammateIdle` | `devflow` | `idle-nudge.sh` |
| `TeammateIdle` | `respond` | `idle-nudge.sh` |
| `TeammateIdle` | `debug-` | `idle-nudge.sh` |

> Full hook list: see [hooks/hooks.json](hooks/hooks.json) — 16 hooks total.

</important>

## Output Styles

Custom output styles at `output-styles/<name>.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `keep-coding-instructions`). Replace default coding instructions unless `keep-coding-instructions: true`.

| Style | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `senior-software-engineer` | Thai, pragmatic senior engineer tone with trade-off focus |
| `senior-software-engineer-en` | English version of above |
| `coding-mentor` | Thai, teaches through doing — adds "Why" explanations |
| `coding-mentor-en` | English version of above |

## Plugin

Plugin manifest at `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Install:

```bash
claude plugin install devflow
claude config set env.CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS 1
```

<important if="adding a new skill">

## Adding a New Skill

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full step-by-step guide. Key rules for Claude when editing:

- `description:` must be trigger-complete (what + when + keywords) — max 1024 chars
- `compatibility:` recommended for skills with external tool dependencies (not required, but contributors need to know what to install)
- Pre-commit hook auto-fixes staged `.md` files — no manual lint needed before commit

</important>

## Skill Comparison & Agent Teams Constraints

| Aspect | review | build | debug-parallel | respond |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | PR review + debate | Full dev loop | Debug + DX harden | PR comment response |
| Execution | 3 teammates (debate) | Dynamic roster per phase | Investigator + DX + Fixer | 1 Fixer per file group |
| Loop | None | Implement-Review (max 3 iter) | Fix-only (max 3 attempts) | Fix-only (max 3 per thread) |

All four require `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` (degrades gracefully). One team per session; team cleanup by lead; Hard Rules cannot be dropped via debate.

## devflow-engine

TypeScript SDK at `devflow-engine/` — programmatic PR review pipeline (orchestrator, triage, consolidator, falsifier, CLI). `private: true`; not published to npm. Uses `bun test` (built-in).

**Resilience (v1.8.1):** `runClaudeSubprocess` retries transient API errors (rate_limit_exceeded, server_error, overloaded_error) up to 3× with exponential backoff (1s/2s). Returns `budgetExceeded: true` signal instead of throwing — caller can skip re-run. Override delay via `DEVFLOW_RETRY_DELAY_MS=0` in tests.

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Run SDK tests | `cd devflow-engine && bun test` |
| Watch tests | `cd devflow-engine && bun test --watch` |
| Run CLI review | `cd devflow-engine && bun run review -- --pr <number>` |

## Repo Commands

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Lint all markdown | `npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"` |
| Validate plugin | `claude plugin validate` (checks plugin.json, frontmatter, hooks.json) |
| Run full QA | `bash scripts/qa-check.sh` (13 gates: shellcheck, markdownlint, bats, plugin validate) |
| Bump version | `bash scripts/bump-version.sh <patch\|minor\|major>` (runs QA gates before release) |

**Contributor dev mode only** (do not use if plugin is installed — will conflict):

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Link one skill | `bash scripts/link-assets.sh <name>` |
| Link everything | `bash scripts/link-assets.sh` (skills, agents, hooks, output-styles) |
| Check link status | `bash scripts/link-assets.sh --list` |

## Gotchas

- `context: fork` + `agent` field runs skills in isolated subagent — used by `env-heal` (haiku, general-purpose). Other skills avoid it for real-time streaming visibility and follow-up interaction
- Pre-commit hook auto-fixes staged `.md` files — runs `scripts/fix-tables.sh` + `markdownlint-cli2 --fix`; no manual fix needed before commit
- **Never use `--no-verify`** when pushing — pre-commit hooks enforce quality gates (markdown lint, table fixes, plugin validation)
- `user-invocable: false` hides from `/` menu but keeps description in context — Claude can still auto-trigger these skills
- Run `/optimize-claude-md` when this file feels stale
